0	as a result although we still make use of this distinction there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed just what is meant by spirit and by matter the terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do for in the modern world neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreedupon elements of experience 	religion
1	when the words are used we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true demons fairies angels and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars 	religion
2	in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general which now cause us much difficulty could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time 	religion
3	in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions there have been indeed many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful all this has not however been an unmixed blessing the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means or at best with wholly inadequate means for dealing with his experience of spirit 	religion
4	we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality as we know and apprehend it with respect to which we can refer this experience science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur millers play the crucible which deals with the salem witch trials as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century 	religion
5	the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures foibles irritations and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people instead the audience can sit back at ease and from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion a teenage girl abigail williams is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle the reverend samuel parris about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night the demon world is populated with real creatures and witches actually can be seen flying through the air 	religion
6	everyone in salem saint and sinner alike is swept up by it it is like a mysterious epidemic which starting first with abigail and parris spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it it grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery moral disintegration and destruction the audience leaves the play under a spell it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes if one asks about this play what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power there is no better answer to give than spirit 	religion
7	in the end the good man john proctor expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says a fire a fire is burning i hear the boot of lucifer i see his filthy face the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this yet are not we of the midtwentieth century who rightly do not believe there is any such thing as the devil just as bad off as they only in a different way 	religion
8	we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false even mr miller himself seems uncertain on this score in a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play he says at one point however that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifers manyfaced lieutenants and his belief is not to his discredit better minds than hales were and still are convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken 	religion
9	the concept of unity in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force in which good and evil are relative everchanging and always joined to the same phenomenon such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of mans worthlessness until redeemed the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or churchstate apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over salem it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power 	religion
10	for this does not account for the integral elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell the reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the authors convictions to the contrary there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit apart from spirit there could be no community for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity cohesiveness and permanence think for example of the spirit of the marine corps 	religion
11	we cannot of course assign it any substance it is not material and is not a thing occupying space and time yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known so it is too with many other spirits which we all know the spirit of nazism or communism school spirit the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan every community if it is alive has a spirit and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity 	religion
12	for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere it is the spirit which is the source of a communitys drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas 	religion
13	the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them it is for them a given which they and they alone possess the spirit of the marine corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it it is they of course who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruits to find as they come into it if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be understanded of the people and this it must not be forgotten is one of the goals of the perennial theological task there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation 	religion
14	the absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents bultmanns intention his point is not that mythology may not be used but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the christian kerygma when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding of existence mythological concepts may by all means still be used but they can be used responsibly only as symbols or ciphers that is only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological or existential terms the statement is often made that when bultmann argues in this way he overestimates the intellectual stumblingblock which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the christian faith 	religion
15	nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated on the contrary even in the heart of the bible belt itself as can be attested by any one who is called to work there the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way together with the corresponding changes in mans picture of himself and his world in fact it is in just such a situation that the profundity of bultmanns argument is disclosed although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class 	religion
16	the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme cultureprotestantism so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the american churches in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand and this usually means one or another of the various forms of folk religion current in the situation this is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent peales cult of reassurance or the other types of a purely cultural christianity is the everpresent need for a demythologized gospel but it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected however even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace 	religion
17	but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation can the church risk assuming that the folly of men is as dear to god as their wisdom or as is also commonly implied that the foolishness of god and the foolishness of men are simply two ways of talking about the same thing can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose cooperation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church which derives however from the heritage of the greeks rather than from the bible that god is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world by analogy the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church 	religion
18	and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume as we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends in arguing in this way we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction but the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable 	religion
19	if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no or where i do not have the right to say anything at all then my only choice is to refuse to be a christian expressed differently if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ is some form of selfdestruction whether of the body or of the mind sacrificium corporis sacrificium intellectus then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter modern man as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us has come of age and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is in fact marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation it is still a positive step forward 	religion
20	in any event it is an irreversible step and if we are at all honest with ourselves we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us to say this of course is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years or at any rate since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought we have aligned ourselves with that liberal tradition in protestant christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of schleiermacher ritschl herrmann harnack and troeltsch and more recently schweitzer and the early barth and in part at least bultmann it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong for we must number here not only the names of bushnell clarke and rauschenbusch not to mention those of the chicago school and macintosh but those of the brothers niebuhr and if america may claim him 	religion
21	what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity they have insisted rather on living fully and completely within modern culture and so far from considering this treason to god have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him when we say then that today in our situation the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement however much we may have to criticize liberal theologys constructive formulations the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism not behind it 	religion
22	for we have said in effect that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion only one is really an alternative if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally the position of the right is clearly untenable whereas bultmanns center position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone the general position of the right as represented say by karl barth involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered it follows then provided the possibilities have been exhausted that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the left which has been represented on the continent by fritz buri and to some extent at least is found in much that is significant in american and english theology in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible we may develop this argument at greater length 	religion
23	to do this it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless question thus if what is at issue is whether all s is p it is indifferent whether some s is not p or no s is p since in either case the judgment in question is false hence if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted for in either event the first possibility is excluded therefore the only conceivable alternatives are those represented on the one hand by the two at least apparently selfconsistent but mutually exclusive positions of buri and barth and on the other hand by the third but really pseudo position analogous to a round square of bultmann 	religion
24	 # accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation and # in so doing frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by means of statements that from bultmanns point of view are mythological one hundred years ago there existed in england the association for the promotion of the unity of christendom representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman and anglican churches and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome this association produced little fruit and in fact was condemned by the holy office in #### now again in #### in england there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as christian unity 	religion
25	many people seem hopeful yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in #### than there was in #### but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope at least on the catholic side for the tide is well on the turn as the london catholic weekly universe has written i came to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman as an american catholic of irish ancestry i came with certain preconceptions and expectations 	religion
26	since arriving here however i have formed a far different religious picture of presentday england in representing part of this new picture i will be recounting some of my own personal experiences reactions and judgments but my primary aim is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the present religious state of england since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit my roman collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman catholic cleric in any case i have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by englishmen even in devonshire and cornwall where anticatholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest 	religion
27	on my first guy fawkes day here i found catholics as well as noncatholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day a birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled the true story of guy fawkes which began  when you pile your guy on the bonfire tomorrow night i wonder how much of the true story of guy fawkes you will remember in the ### years since the first guy fawkes night much of the story has been forgotten so here is a reminder the article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill king james # 	religion
28	the return of the catholic hierarchy in #### was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and in fact was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty in #### newman professedly had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers now in #### the catholic population of england is still quite small ten per cent or # million yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population a protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham oratory catholic church on sunday mornings 	religion
29	she may not have been exact on this number but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university following anglican evensong at which there was a congregation of twelve he celebrated mass before more than a hundred the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches according to a newspaper report of the #### statistics of the church of england the total of confirmed members is ####### but only ####### are registered on the parochial church rolls and over ## million people in england are baptized into the church of england but roughly only a tenth of them continue 	religion
30	a further ### anglican churches have been demolished since #### and in the last five years the methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or more often the sale of ### chapels most of these former churches are now used as warehouses but neither anglicans nor nonconformists object to selling churches to roman catholics and have done so while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period and that religious population shifts have emptied churches a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are going to church it should be admitted too that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics one paper writes ## per cent 	religion
31	an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true a century ago newman saw that liberalism what we now might call secularism would gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism and that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own that day is perhaps today #### and it seems no longer very meaningful to call england a protestant country one of the ironies of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not relatively speaking many real christians to unite many english catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy 	religion
32	with traditional nationalistic spirit some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism at its best i have found myself saying with other foreigners here that english catholics are good catholics it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses at mass they hope of course to reclaim the noncatholic population to the catholic faith and at every sunday benediction they recite by heart the prayer for england  o blessed virgin mary mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother look down in mercy upon england thy dowry and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee 	religion
33	 a hymn often to be heard in catholic churches is faith of our fathers which glories in englands ancient faith that endured persecution and which proclaims faith of our fathers marys prayers shall win our country back to thee the english saints are widely venerated quite naturally and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs and cardinal newman will soon be canonized because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers english catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being unenglish i have not seen this charge made during my stay here but apparently it is still in the air for example a writer in a recent number of the queen hyperbolically states that of the myriad imprecations the only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are unenglish 	religion
34	one of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid##th century is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics partly because religious tests were removed only in #### moreover for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs now not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at oxford but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the noncatholic members of the university catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the cherwell with noncatholic students 	religion
35	the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant churches on successive sundays during october #### paul ferris a noncatholic wrote articles in the observer depicting clergymen of the church of england the church of rome and the nonconformist church the catholic priest though somewhat superficially drawn easily came out the best there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of midvictorian england 	religion
36	catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergymen a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool dr heenan and the anglican archbishop of york dr ramsey recently appointed archbishop of canterbury the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in england the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months and it was interesting to observe that bbcs television film on christmas eve was the bells of st marys 	religion
37	it was the first time an english primate has done this since the ##th century english catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope almost daily something is reported which feeds this catholic hope in england statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and irish catholic immigrants news of a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit a report that a catholic nun had been requested to teach in a noncatholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters 	religion
38	a report that ### protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive mass offered for christian unity at a catholic church in slough during the church unity octave the death of a man is unique and yet it is universal the straight line would symbolize its uniqueness the circle its universality but how can one figure symbolize both christianity declares that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal concur 	religion
39	to be the savior and the lord jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with mans history yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind his history is his alone yet each man must recognize his own history in it his death is his alone yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus 	religion
40	not a circle then nor a straight line but a spiral represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence as represented by a spiral history may in some sense be said to repeat itself the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam as origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ 	religion
41	from gods will and wisdom and from virgin earth for god had not rained says the scripture before man was made and there was no man to till the earth from this earth then while it was still virgin god took dust and fashioned the man the beginning of humanity irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals but as universal human beings who were and are all of humanity adam and eve were perfect not in the sense that they possessed perfection but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection 	religion
42	therefore there is no need for him as there is for origen to identify existence itself with the fall existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence of a preexistent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history the biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words so god created man in his own image in the similitude of god he created him there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguished so most notably in the statement if the holy spirit is absent from the soul such a man is indeed of an animal nature 	religion
43	thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster the similitude of god by contrast is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature recent research on irenaeus however makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction he does not mean to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall for he was created not exactly immortal nor yet exactly mortal but capable of immortality as well as of mortality 	religion
44	and he laid down for him certain conditions so that if he kept the command of god then he would always remain as he was that is immortal but if he did not he would become mortal melting into earth whence his frame had been taken these conditions man did not keep and thus he became mortal yet he did not stop being human as a result there is no justification for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of god humanity and the similitude of god immortality 	religion
45	he was in the words of irenaeus beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality the true way to immortality lay through obedience but man did not believe this for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin and even as she having indeed a husband adam but being nevertheless as yet a virgin having become disobedient was made the cause of death both to herself and to the entire human race so also did mary having a man betrothed to her and being nevertheless a virgin by yielding obedience become the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race 	religion
46	his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin mary that parallelism affects his picture of mans disobedience too for as it was christ the word of god who came to rescue man so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought death into the world and all our woe with this act of disobedience and not with the inception of his individual existence man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality at the nadir of that circuit is death 	religion
47	wherefore as they became forfeit to death from that moment they were handed over to it this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed namely on a friday as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday he sees a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath in any case though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree they obtained mortality instead mans life originally shaped for immortality and for communion with god must now be conformed to the shape of death 	religion
48	even death therefore has a providential as well as a punitive function  wherefore also he god drove him man out of paradise and removed him far from the tree of life not because he envied him the tree of life as some venture to assert but because he pitied him and did not desire that he should continue a sinner for ever nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal and evil interminable and irremediable but he set a bound to his state of sin by interposing death and thus causing sin to cease putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh which should take place in the earth so that man ceasing at length to live in sin and dying to it might live to god this idea which occurs in both tatian and cyprian fits especially well into the scheme of irenaeus theology for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ 	religion
49	it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is it is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam who does indeed come to destroy sin but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality this emphasis upon death rather than sin as mans fundamental problem irenaeus shares with many early theologians especially the greekspeaking ones they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility which can mean though it does not have to mean deliverance from time and history 	religion
50	it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated but they dare not be confused or identified the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older in short whether adams life was intended to be part of the process of time if it was then it must have been gods intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity 	religion
51	and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal the embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change on the other hand christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence it is the wages of sin and its sting is the law if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator 	religion
52	if death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal ie created existence such an interpretation of death radically alters the christian view of creation for it teaches salvation from not salvation in time and history because christianity teaches not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ furthermore as an encouragement to revisionist thinking it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes 	religion
53	ezra stiles gannett an honorable representative of the sanhedrin addressed himself frankly to the issue in #### insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist even so gannett judiciously argued the association could legitimately decide that parker should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness we today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations one can even argue though this is a delicate matter that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture to the first church and so to suppress it rather than let parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it finally it did seem clear as day to these clergymen as gannetts son explained in the biography of his father they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of christians 	religion
54	grant all this still when modern unitarianism and the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults parker lavished upon them or else argue that after all parker received the treatment he invited they betray an uneasy conscience whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of parker and the fraternity on january ## #### while it may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker leave the association while it may plead that dr n l frothingham had every warrant for stating the difference between trinitarians and unitarians is a difference in christianity the difference between mr parker and the association is a difference between no christianity and christianity despite these supposed conclusive assurances the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief of positive thanksgiving that the association never quite brought itself officially to expel parker had it done so the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible nor could the harvard divinity school assemble today to honor parkers insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying peccavi happily for posterity then the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality 	religion
55	whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room though not out of the fellowship in the hall after adjournment dr frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested parker to visit him whereupon our burly theodore again burst into tears all this near tragedy which to us borders on comedy enables us to tell the story over and over again always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency it was indeed a near thing but somehow the inherent decency of new england which we inherit did triumph to the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it 	religion
56	in both cases the stubborn fact remains liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates both legitimate offspring of its loins and when brought to the test it behaved shabbily suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about however there is a crucial difference between the two histories emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside or rather by leaving it behind him he walked out of the unitarian communion so that it could lick the wound of his departure preserve its selfrespect and eventually accord him pious veneration 	religion
57	hence he was in his lifetime as is the memory of him afterwards a canker within the liberal sensitivity he still points an accusing finger at all of us telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat actually the dispute between parker and the society of his time both ecclesiastical and social was a real one a bitter one it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of selfdeprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him the fact is incontestable that liberal world of unitarian boston was narrowminded intellectually sterile smug afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened 	religion
58	nevertheless we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace their passions were genuine and the division between them and the abolitionists is clearcut but parker as the ultraliberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom even though his theological theses have become to us commonplaces the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us it has been endlessly rephrased but i may here put it thus at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant 	religion
59	there can be no doubt the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior the gentle channing revered by all bostonians orthodox or unitarian wrote to a friend in louisville that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action no city in the world is governed so little by a police and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment we stand more in awe of one another than most people opinion is less individual or runs more into masses and often rules with a rod of iron even more poignantly and with the insight of a genius channing added remember this is channing not parker 	religion
60	channing wrote this in a letter i think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons but theodore parker commencing his mission to the worldatlarge disguised as the minister of a twentyeighth congregational church which bore no resemblance to the congregational polities descended from the founders among which were still the unitarian churches made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum because he spoke openly with what channing had prophesied someone might with daring hyperbole parker vindicated channings further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution and only within those defined limits a license 	religion
61	he arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with at the least resentment what otherwise could the lawyer doctor minister the men of science and letters do when told that they had become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant and continually cried holy holy holy is the almighty dollar nor when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as parker snarled at them thus talk about the catholics voting as the bishop tells there are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom nor a mitre on their head who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome but to the almighty dollar a pope much nearer home boston has been controlled by a few capitalists lawyers and other managers who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think 	religion
62	it was duty he said that his parents had given him as a rule beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied and it was duty he would perform though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty parker could weep and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents  if it gave me pleasure to say hard things he wrote i would shut up forever we have to tell ourselves that when parker spoke in this vein he believed what he said because he could continue but the truth which cost me bitter tears to say i must speak though it cost other tears hotter than fire because he copiously shed his own tears and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other peoples consciences 	religion
63	it is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody professing the deepest piety decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the water into wine at eleven am on the third of august ad ## we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed so we are the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy to salute his courage and to pass on happily forgetting both him and the entire episode we have not the leisure or the patience or the skill to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor the majesterial andrews norton by saying that while he believed jesus like other religious teachers worked miracles i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine i have within the past fifty years come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt 	religion
64	i have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world in an amateurish yet in a very real sense i have followed the developments of archaeology geology astronomy herpetology and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields at one time i became disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both old and new testaments by a higher criticism of the bible to refute which i felt the need of a better knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and like some higher critical friends trying to continue to use the bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations attempting to bridge the chasm between an older reverent bibleloving generation and a critical doubting bibleemancipated race although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book i stood outside shivering in the cold 	religion
65	now if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking through his servant it is johns gospel to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the bible here i took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path to which we might give the modern name of pragmatism or the thing that works test it try it and if it works accept it as a guiding principle so i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself and then tested it to see how it worked 	religion
66	the next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly science and i submitted to its conditions according to christs invitation and promise that if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself john # ## the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god son of man by the virgin mary the saviour of the world i believe therefore that we are without exception sinners by nature alienated from god and that jesus christ the son of god came to earth the representative head of a new race to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world and that he who thus receives christ as his personal saviour is born again spiritually with new privileges appetites and affections destined to live and grow in his likeness forever nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable moral life although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues i now ever look for christ according to his promises and those of the old testament as well to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth 	religion
67	the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body again as faith reveals god my father and christ my saviour i follow without question where he leads me daily by his spirit of love wisdom power and prayer i place his precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to him i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge and daring to trust him even though called to stand alone before the world our lords invitation with its implied promise to all is come and see 	religion
68	as i ministered to his needs i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the lord in his heart he had that peace of which the lord spoke when he said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid what a joy to realize that we too can claim this promise tendered by the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him he was about to leave them to depart from this world and return to his father in heaven 	religion
69	i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lords guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients how often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room asking for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the saviour and his creatures looking unto god the prophet isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee are you longing for peace in your heart 	religion

77	the teacher thought it was so successful that she asks wouldnt it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries dr george w crane a medical columnist thinks it would he says that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously each week an estimated ## million patients call upon us doctors of this number ##% or ## million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever 	religion
78	one of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days people are giving their doctors a hard time one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles and he reported that ##% of them worried about things that never happened ##% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control 	religion
79	##% of them worried about their friends neighbors and relatives most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves only #% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention well most of our fears may be unfounded but after you discover that fact you have something else to worry about why then do we have these fears what is the real cause of them what is there about us that makes us so anxious 	religion
80	we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers we spend billions of dollars at the race tracks and more billions on other forms of gambling we spend billions of dollars on liquor and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moments relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks and after he had seen it all he said to a friend you must be a very sad people 	religion
81	he should have said jittery for thats what we are watch people flock to amusement houses cocktail lounges and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something in one of his writings pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates yes and as tension mounts in this world fear is increasing does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business 	religion
82	i doubt that fear parties and group confessionals will help very much suppose we do get our fears out in the open what then isnt that where most of them are already right out on the front page of our newspapers maybe we are talking about them too much the question is what are we going to do about them 	religion
83	hitler did just that ## years ago building up tensions that first led to a munich and then to a world war the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate it is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack it could have the same effect on communists the president of the united states has said we will never negotiate out of fear and we will never fear to negotiate 	religion
84	and thats another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears to develop the poise that promotes peace turning to the word of god we find the only sure way to do that in psalm ## # you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you or to drive them out if they have you in their grip the lord is my light and my salvation the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid 	religion
85	he didnt live in a world of perpetual peril like ours he didnt know anything about the problems we face today read the next two verses when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me in this will i be confident that is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today isnt it 	religion
86	he has already devoured huge areas of the world putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire reducing them to slavery systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison yes indeed we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us what a terrible thing that wailing wall in berlin a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family another man tried to swim across the river from the east to the west but was shot and killed 	religion
87	the entrance to a church has been walled up so that the congregation most of which is in the western sector cannot worship god there anymore practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city people stand at the wall giving vent to their feelings weeping pounding it with their fists pleading for loved ones but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity there is only one escape left a tragic one and too many people are taking it suicide 	religion
88	these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door we are all involved in them deeply involved and there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world the lord is my light and my salvation the lord is the strength of my life 	religion
89	notice that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret of his faith first the lord is my light he lived in a very dark world but he was not in the dark the same god who called this world into being when he said let there be light  those were his very first creative words he began the world with light this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness 	religion
90	in fact he came into this world himself in the person of his son jesus christ who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of christ he could only see the light coming over the horizon we live in the bright daylight of that great event for us it is a fact in history 	religion
91	this is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of god the lord is my salvation he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his sins if god could do that he could do anything the enemies at his gate threatening to eat up his flesh were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul and god had conquered that one by his grace 	religion
92	the apostle paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him freely give us all things if god be for us who can be against us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword this is the key to the conquest of fear 	religion
93	when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus christ when we know that he is our savior that he has paid our debt with his blood that he has met the demands of gods justice and thus has turned his wrath away when we know that we have peace with god in our hearts and then with this god on our side we can face the whole world without fear and so the psalmist gives us one more picture of god the lord is the strength of my life it recalls those words of another psalm god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth 	religion
94	thus while it remains possible that the babylonians and/or the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years the lo shu square as an expression of centralitythe concept of the middle kingdom at peace strong and united under a forceful ruler which had been only a longedfor ideal in the time of the warring states was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese empire under the chin dynasty ###### bc but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor shih huangti in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hardwon national unity was the burning of the books in ### bc with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking 	religion
95	many of the latter were destroyed in their turn during the burning of the vast chin palace some ten years later yet some must have survived because the old interest in number symbolism divination and magic persisted on into the han dynasty which succeeded in reuniting china and keeping it together for a longer period from ### bc to ad ### in fact during the first century bc an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects finding its typical expression in the socalled wei books a number of which were specifically devoted to the lo shu and related numerical diagrams especially in connection with divination however the wei books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in ### after all this destruction of old literature it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu which was already semisecret anyhow 	religion
96	although modern scholars have expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three a mere mathematical puzzle was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself but up to now no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties or the numerical significance of its numbers singly or in combination and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concepts such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu # was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram the importance of this # can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers quite apart from any numerological considerations which is to say any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it indeed mathematically speaking it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram 	religion
97	then if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square through multiplying it by the highest number # which is the square of the base number the result is ## and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed furthermore the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers by reason of its central position it is also their mathematical mean since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair all of which equal ## in fact the neat balance of these pairs and their subtle equilibrium would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese 	religion
98	and in this square the respective pairs made up of large and small odd yang numbers and those composed of large and small even yin numbers were all equal to each other thus all differences were leveled and all contrasts erased in a realm of no distinction and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis the tremendous emphasis on the # in the lo shu square for purely mathematical reasons and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number # and why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century bc when the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions and took # as the dynastic number believing that he would thus place himself his imperial family and the nation under the most auspicious influences 	religion
99	after this time inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors as well as other writings emphasized the desirability of keeping ones self at the center of the universe where cosmic forces were strongest later we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally all this emphasis on centrality and on the number # as a symbolic expression of the center which seems to have begun as far back as ### bc also may conceivably have led to the development of the fiveelements school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five we find for example such groupings as the five ancient rulers the five sacred mountains the five directions with center the five metals five colors five tastes five odors five musical notes five bodily functions five viscera and many others this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself as though they had served as the base for all the rest 	religion
100	and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four obviously something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives and that may have been the workings of the lo shu this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries 	religion
101	although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers this was actually only a beginning of wonders for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time as such one cannot fully understand the thought of the prehan and han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu but conversely one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese which they felt they saw expressed in it the chinese world view during the han dynasty when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity was based in large part on the teachings of the yinyang and fiveelements school which was traditionally founded by tsou yen 	religion
102	heaven acting through the tao expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles the yin and the yang the yang or male principle was the source of light heat and dynamic vitality associated with the sun while the yin or female principle flourished in darkness cold and quiet inactivity and was associated with the moon together these two principles influenced all things and in varying combinations they were present in everything we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang while the even numbers were yin so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center 	religion
103	instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine provinces as was usually done this equated the odd yang numbers with mountains firm and resistant hence yang and the even numbers with rivers sinuous and yielding hence yin taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china thus the middle number # represented sungshan in honan central china the # taishan in shantung east china the # hwashan in shensi west china 	religion
104	and the # huoshan in anhwei which was then the south sacred mountain for the rivers the # represented the huai to the then southeast the # the san kiang three rivers in the then southwest the # the chi in the northeast and the # the upper yellow river in the northwest 	religion
105	but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was equated with the nine provinces and whenever the lo shu involved directional symbolism it was oriented in this same fashion few persons who join the church are insincere they earnestly desire to do the will of god 	religion
106	these fatalities are dramatic evidence of halfway evangelism a failure to follow through a program of lay visitation evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship the work of lay visitation evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have been interviewed in the average situation about onethird of those visited make commitments to christ and the church the pastor and the membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program 	religion
107	churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep ## to ## per cent of their new members loyal and active this is the answer to the problem of membership delinquency it is important that persons desiring to unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant it is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications preparation for church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received 	religion
108	some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors it should not be postponed later than the next day a helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference if possible he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present 	religion
109	he will discuss the significance of christian commitment the necessity of family religion and private devotions and the importance of the membership preparation sessions there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer a piece of devotional material such as the upper room may be left in each home a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults 	religion
110	they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes others meet on sunday night at the midweek service or for a series of four nights some pastors have two sessions in one evening with a refreshment period between the sessions should cover four major areas a	religion
111	this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday in this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life service opportunities the church school missions mens work womens work youth program social activities and finances the budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session 	religion
112	 the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments the social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members in conducting the membership preparationinquirers class the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each generally held on sunday night or during the week this gives greater opportunity for the learning process 	religion
113	some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly urge them to write out their questions for the box use a textbook with assigned readings each week select class members for reports on various phases of the study 	religion
114	ask each member to write a statement on such topics as what christ means to me what the church means to me why join the church the duties of church members etc assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized invite class members to share in an extra period of bible study each week ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty to the reception service there is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory training including those coming by transfer of membership 	religion
115	people appreciate experiences that demand something of them those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule for most of them it will be their first experience in membership training since this is a recent development in many churches those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed the preparatory class is an introductory facetoface group in which new members become acquainted with one another 	religion
116	the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church this should be a high moment in their lives a nevertobeforgotten experience they should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages every detail of the service merits careful attention the hymns the sermon the ritual the right hand of fellowship the introduction to the congregation the welcome of the congregation this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation 	religion
117	it can mean the difference between participation and inaction spiritual growth and decay the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church the atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience psychologically the reception should be the climax following the sermon ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and pledge cards 	religion
118	provide a name card for each new member arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together invite sponsors or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service give each new member a certificate of membership introduce each new member to the congregation asking him to face the congregation 	religion
119	have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests chapter # planning for the assimilation and growth of new membersthe church is the family of god 	religion
120	every member of the family must have a vital place in its life yet the most difficult problem in the churchs program of evangelism is right at this point helping new members to become participating growing parts of the fellowship very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive a study of major denominational membership statistics over a twentyyear period revealed the appalling fact that nearly ## per cent of those who joined the church were lost to the church within seven years one denomination had a membership of ####### at the beginning of the period under study and twenty years later its membership stood at ####### a net growth of only ###### 	religion
121	another major church body had ####### members and twenty years later its membership stood at ####### during this time ####### new members were brought into the fellowship still another denomination had ####### members twenty years ago during this period ####### members were received yet the net membership now is only ####### these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership 	religion
122	studies of membership trends even in some areas where population is expanding show that numbers of churches have had little net increase though many new members were received the local family of god has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare new members can become participating growing members but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life the entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process 	religion
123	those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest however it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship when they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians the church expects certain things of those who become members the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family 	religion
124	care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him but with these two qualifications the statement stands the statement also points to a classic paradox the more men turn toward god who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones with a resultant fragmentation of the human race massacres attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender the words of cardinal newman come forcibly to mind oh how we hate one another for the love of god 	religion
125	institutions require structure form and definition and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms to escape this fate it must rule some things out for every criterion which defines what something is at the same time proclaims implicitly if not openly what that something is not some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether 	religion
126	man is at once a gregarious animal and a formcreating being having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools both eventualities are possible logically but practically they are impossible as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him 	religion
127	is there any way out of the predicament the only way that i can see is through communication interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries approached creatively it is a high art it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart gods intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary 	religion
128	what are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history i shall touch on three areas personal national and theological by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality structure some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all but by the need of men to have persons they can blame distrust denounce and even hate modern psychology has shown that paralleling the authoritarian personality is the bigoted personality in which insecurity inferiority suspicion and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally 	religion
129	to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all for they have no redeeming features whatsoever it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they rather than pretexts for them that are causing the trouble and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial nationalism is more variable the specific instance i have in mind is the afroasian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century 	religion
130	no less than twentytwo nations have already achieved independence since world war # and the number is growing by the year as an obvious consequence obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area relations between christians and nonchristians in these lands colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious for christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other actually however this turns out to be only part of the picture nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries 	religion
131	insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate transpolitical justifications for their existence such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone elses all this works severely against the kind of crosscultural communication for which christian missions stand africans and asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda the people hardest hit by this suspicion are of course christians on the mainland of china for example in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion 	religion
132	again india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru and his followers is gone the progressive closing of afroasian ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo i was seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists world radio program he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them after returning to the united states and raising the money he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available 	religion
133	they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of antichristian sentiment ironically these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since world war # while the more established denominations are barely maintaining prewar staffs although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and nonchristians in asia the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain afroasian religions themselves the partition of india has hardly improved relations between hindus and muslims 	religion
134	the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state whatever its political form the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof one of our foremost jurists david dudley field has gone so far as to call this provision the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history the trend throughout the worlds religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment pakistan was created in #### expressly as a muslim state but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political situation 	religion
135	the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly secular and while the nation was formerly named the islamic republic of pakistan it is now simply the republic of pakistan the new regime in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months during the years when israel was passing from crisis to crisis the sinai campaign the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties 	religion
136	and in this country gustave weigels delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state the failure at that time of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to father weigels theological argument everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible in a word too human to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed 	religion
137	leslie newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and his finished work but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it newbiggins qualification on the christian claim is of considerable significance the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of its priests father feeney for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church in mentioning this under salvation reconsidered i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit the termination of the human race by human action because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing they know exactly what they mean 	religion
138	yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great or evil repelled sufficiently grave to warrant the destruction of mankind by mans own action i mean however that the moral theologian knows what he means by permit he is not talking in the main about probabilities risks and danger in general he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result as it efficaciously does some good he is talking about double effects of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other but causes both 	religion
139	this is what in a technical sense to only permit an evil result means it means to do it and to know one is doing it but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends of course grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation or to the action of any leader or leaders which for any supposed good permits in this sense the termination of the human race by human action certainly in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative naturally where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain this has to be taken into account 	religion
140	presumably if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic speculative future good by the same token not every present certain and immediate good or lesser evil that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic speculative and future evil nevertheless according to the traditional theory a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action 	religion
141	he does what he can and may and must without regarding himself as lord of the future or on the other hand as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not permit in the sense explained by contrast a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities and not with the moral nature of the action to be done and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result whether by anyones doing or by accident it finds itself driven to inaction to nonpolitical action in politics and nonmilitary action in military affairs and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based mr philip toynbee writes for example that in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues if it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin 	religion
142	he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically ie by considering the worst possible outcome namely the total domination of the world by russia within a few years this would be by far the better choice when it is a question of allowing the human race to survive possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish nevertheless the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified it is a possible result however improbable  the worst and least probable result  if it didnt prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing 	religion
143	if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms then we need to submit ourselves to the following simple test have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are thus moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself its intention and proximate effect or the thing to be done several of the replies to mr toynbee without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil  it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation 	religion
144	but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase but may be deliberately reduced by precautions against accidents or by limiting war  quoting mr kennans phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war he toynbee says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war  if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility most men will choose the latter  if philip toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war i think he is right i do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war 	religion
145	let us therefore put first things first and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be mr philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of orwell in nineteen eightyfour if he believed communism was not only evil but also irredeemably evil then he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense or a static order in which no changes will take place in time to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some paxordo preserved by clothed or naked force 	religion
146	not to repel injury and uphold and improve paxordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment  i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country by some deliberate act of refusal than die uselessly by atomisation would such an act of refusal be useful he does not mean in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition that if we took the risk of surrendering a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender 	religion
147	this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war by creating a monopoly in one power of the worlds arsenal of unlimited weapons it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it in the past  it is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted to the very last 	religion
148	the only contrary action in the future as in the past runs the risk of war and now and in the future unlike in the past any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will by human action render this planet less habitable by the human race that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to permitted effects and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated or not directly morally related to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures finally just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing by human action to accelerate this end we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankinds thrusts toward we know not what future 	religion
149	for almost onesixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as selfevident by most americans few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders this pressure has urged reevaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country it is not surprising that as spokesman for real estate interests the national association of real estate boards nareb and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure 	religion
150	what does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest what ought to be what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change what social ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation recently a group of the faculty at wesleyan universitys public affairs center sought some answers to these questions several new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers political scientists economists social psychologists social ethicists and theologians 	religion
151	for a number of years wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy this article presents our observations of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the selfimages held by most realtors within the membership of this group as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations the most ready portrayal of oneself to the public is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner 	religion
152	obviously much more than customer expectation is determining the realtors role judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers income educational level and above all racial extraction and whether these would qualify them for congenial happy relations to other people in certain community areas how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of narebs code of ethics article ## in the code adopted in #### states that a realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood though the reference to race was stricken by the association in #### being an agent of such detrimental influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid 	religion
153	all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced nonwhite particularly negro peoples into allwhite restricted areas they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate professionals but agitators for some kind of cause or reform and this was no longer to be a pro obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of professional with narrow skills and specialization the effective servicing of a client rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of ones work these men for the most part educated in our best new england colleges well established financially and socially in the community under kindly but insistent probing reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a clientservice relationship this narrow professionalism does not even fit the present realities of their situation as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase 	religion
154	realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work as members of social and professional organizations as citizens and civic leaders as church laymen as university alumni as newspaper readers etc from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding it seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas # the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue  # their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes and most pervasively # their interpretation of who is a real pro of what it means to be a professional man in a technical fragmented society 	religion
155	the commission on race and housing concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced on the whole than any other segment of the american population but such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices also it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed like business and university groups generally these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make realtors both generally and in this group have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension 	religion
156	there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the negroes desire for wellkept housing privacy etc data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically significantly no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes published by the university of california press that present the commissions findings no one anticipates any radical shift in this situation but questions concerning reading habits the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised 	religion
157	relevant facts however extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of harmonious neighborhoods discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of ones democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife  # realtors realize of course that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing on the positive side recent federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position antidiscriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and while specific provisions have varied the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage 	religion
158	as far as they were aware the connecticut association of real estate boards had not officially opposed the bills passage or lobbied in its support  this has not been the case everywhere in #### the real estate boards of new york city actively opposed the then pending private housing antidiscrimination law official reasoning the bill was a wanton invasion of basic property rights there are sins of omission as well as commission 	religion
159	judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on shelley v kraemer #### has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry but there is little evidence that realtors or at least their associations have repudiated the principle in such clauses in the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of social reformism that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid but as yet no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into allwhite neighborhoods one of the roles of the social scientist ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work 	religion
160	such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world let us say a community that embraces scarsdale or yonkers but is also infinitely richer since it is allinclusive that community of all creation is then the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment racial discrimination is wrong then not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator thus moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions  # over the years individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed 	religion
161	but what significance attaches to professional beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a clients stated needs as already noted our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other as a theologian in the group pointed out a professional was before the modern period of technical specialization one who professed to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills if we look about the world today we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization science and religion science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom 	religion
162	how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge and yet there is a note of hope because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material a universe that in a word is not matter but music and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith to see this vision in perspective we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom 	religion
163	it was only about the size of a baseball but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of ##### tons of aj that is enough tnt to fill the tower of the empire state building and with the availability of bombs of that size war became a new problem now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world 	religion
164	hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce we know that we have hydrogen in water water is af and the h stands for hydrogen there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies i have calculated that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on hiroshima 	religion
165	and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond salt water is still af the same hydrogen is there and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today of course there is also an optimistic side to the picture for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days 	religion
166	with just the hydrogen of our bodies we could run the world for years then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world provide adequate housing food education abundant living for everyone everywhere now let us see where this power comes from to grasp our new view of the atom we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is 	religion
167	one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms and i asked myself a question suppose i had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body how large an area would they cover i calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body that is a figure one with ## ciphers quite a large number then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator 	religion
168	a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at this rate so i decided to take another measure the whole state of pennsylvania imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania but instead of snowing snow it snows peas so we get the whole state covered with peas about four feet deep 	religion
169	pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas but we still have a long way to go next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe north america south america europe asia and africa all covered with peas four feet deep next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas then we go out among the neighboring stars collect ### planets each the size of the earth and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep finally we go into the farthest reaches of the milky way 	religion
170	so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are now although an atom is small we can still in imagination have a look at it let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow a magic alice in wonderland growing pill i start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me i shoot up through the roof into the sky past the clouds through the stratosphere out beyond the moon out among the planets until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long 	religion
171	and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom according to the physics of forty years ago you would see circulating over your head down at the sides and under your feet some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs these balls are moving in great circles and ellipses and are of course the electrons the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone since these electrons are moving like planets you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom so you look down there and you see a tiny whirling point about the size of the head of a pin this is the atomic sun the atomic nucleus 	religion
172	it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits it also contains nearly all the mass and the atomic energy you may ask what else there is and the answer is nothing nothing but empty space and since you are made of atoms you are nothing much but empty space too if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper 	religion
173	at any rate it shows us how immaterial we are now this #### view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture for we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics and therefore the atom was really just a little machine and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts 	religion
174	and since the universe is also made of atoms it is just a supermachine and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe governed by the laws of cause and effect bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists then came the scientific revolution in the late ####s a suggestion from louis de broglie a physicist in france showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves 	religion
175	now as you step inside instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it these ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony harmony melody counterpoint symphonic structure are there 	religion
176	and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music the island of nantucket part of the state of massachusetts lies about thirtyone miles southeast of its mother state some of the island is sand and is not suitable for living the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors during about three and a half months of the year in the summer there are three boats that run from the mainland to the island carrying passengers food and cars 	religion
177	this is a fine trip too on a good day with marthas vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other it makes an excellent trip of about three hours to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect the united states of america in the nineteenth century how far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age to what extent did it mould the morals and the social economic and political life and institutions of the country 	religion
178	even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of christianity from other factors although a complete picture cannot be given we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor at times we can say that it was the major factor what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation as we have seen a growing proportion although in #### still a minority were members of churches 	religion
179	many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock for others the protestantism of the nineteenthcentury immigration for still others mostly of the nineteenthcentury immigration it was roman catholicism and for a small minority it was eastern orthodoxy upon all of them played the intellectual social political and economic attitudes institutions and customs of the nation upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was 	religion
180	at best only an approximation could be arrived at to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd for instance we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose the temptation is to say that as the percentage of church members mounted the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed 	religion
181	if guilty the offender might be excluded from membership as church membership burgeoned such measures faded into desuetude but whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation we have already hinted at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life 	religion
182	throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour in the twentieth century its influence grew as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenthcentury immigration the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the older stock thus america the most widely sung of the patriotic songs was written by a new england baptist clergyman samuel francis smith ######## while a student in andover theological seminary 	religion
183	the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith here was what was called the american dream namely the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of katherine lee bates ######## daughter and granddaughter of new england congregational ministers in her widely sung hymn written in #### america the beautiful with the words o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness america america god mend thy every flaw confirm thy soul in self control the liberty in law o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears 	religion
184	the american dream was compounded of many strains some were clearly of christian origin among them the great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian liberty christian equality and christian fraternity the passion of the land some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection as the fountainhead of the american hope here too must be placed unitarianism and less obviously from christian inspiration emerson transcendentalism and the idealism of walt whitman we must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth among them melville hawthorne and henry james the elder all of them out of a christian background 	religion
185	a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills significantly the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century came from men and women of new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian congregationalism several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism quakers some from new england had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the seventh day adventists christian science the american board of commissioners for foreign missions the american home missionary society the american bible society and new england theology 	religion
186	the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others looked for the early coming of the millennium and was paralleled by the confidence in mans ability cherished by the unitarians emerson and the transcendentalists we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles and the pietism of the continent of europe among them prison reform antislavery measures legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour the inner mission and the red cross we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century 	religion
187	still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age the movement to end negro slavery began before #### and mounted after that year until as a result of the civil war emancipation was achieved long before #### the christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly for example in #### the philadelphia yearly meeting of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in #### it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply in the latter year samuel hopkins from whom the hopkinsian strain of new england theology took its name asked the continental congress to abolish slavery 	religion
188	beginning at least as far back as #### various baptist bodies condemned slavery after #### antislavery sentiment mounted chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock the nineteenthcentury immigration whether protestant or roman catholic was not so much concerned for very few if any among them held slaves they were mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out or were too povertystricken to own slaves benjamin lundy ######## a quaker was a pioneer in preparing the way for antislavery societies it was he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison ######## to the subject 	religion
189	chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of immediate and unconditional abolition he also espoused a great variety of other causes among them womens rights prohibition and justice to the indians incurably optimistic dogmatic and utterly fearless in his youth a devout baptist in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john greenleaf whittier ######## he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible a marked impulse came to the antislavery movement through the finney revivals finney himself while opposed to slavery placed his chief emphasis on evangelism but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the antislavery campaign theodore dwight weld ######## was especially active 	religion
190	as a youth he became one of finneys band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men a strong temperance advocate through the influence of a favorite teacher charles stewart another finney convert he devoted himself to the antislavery cause a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological seminary and had to leave because of their open antislavery position the majority then went to the infant oberlin they and others employed some of finneys techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause 	religion
191	he shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame wendell phillips ######## from a prominent massachusetts family in his teens was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils he remained a devout christian he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition but he also stood for equal rights for women for opportunity for the freedmen and for prohibition the antislavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by arthur tappan ######## and his younger brother lewis tappan ######## 	religion
192	they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer even more terrible abilities their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power thus the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors but this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities 	religion
193	the royal ritual generated power into the other world it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world but naturally the royal ritual which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom this is the familiar system of cosmic government the chinese emperor by proper observance of ritual manifested divine powers 	religion
194	by swaying the balance between them he effected the alternation of the seasons his power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions in this system no man is exempt from obligations failure in daily moral and ethical duties to ones family outrages to community propriety any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead and to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters 	religion
195	and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear the common belief was that there existed one moral order which included everything the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code 	religion
196	modern westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection living in urban conditions away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatchedroof world view the individual may find it possible say to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns in china the magical system par excellence was taoism the taoists were quietist mystics who saw an unchanging unity the tao underlying all phenomena 	religion
197	the taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation in other words they were actually an organization of magicians mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced into china it underwent extensive changes during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader 	religion
198	the selfrealized mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic that made the world into a huge magical garden in its monastic form mahayana was merely an organization of magicpracticing monks bonzes who catered to the chinese faith in the supernatural nonmagical confucianism was a secular rational philosophy but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power 	religion
199	but let us not be mistaken about confucian virtue this was not virtue as we understand the word today and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation to the confucian virtue simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones propriety was synonymous with ritual observance the mark of a true gentleman to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for mans fate 	religion
200	promoters of zen to the west record its ancestry and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism but the marvelous person that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality than indian speculation he possesses magical powers and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls proponents of zen to the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism in zen probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic but in the chinese mind there was little difference between the two the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be actually zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism 	religion
201	this is well evidenced by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen the idea of the inward turning of thought the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity peace and stillness a union with the infinite with the tao could be effected in fact the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the direct thinking zennist was a feature of taoism so too was the insistence on the relativity of the external world and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure indwelling spirit the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience one of its features attractive to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts 	religion
202	but this is not the spirit of selfreliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistakes it it is simply that in taoist tradition as in all good mysticisms books words or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience the truth the eternal truth is not transmittable by words reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge but a positive handicap the technique of reality confusion the use of paradox and riddles to shake the minds grip on reality originated with fourth and third century bc chinese quietism the koan is not basically a new device 	religion
203	in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdomwide ordering of nature popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers and this is only natural witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest wonder drug early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence but this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers the anchorite strove in fact to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power 	religion
204	as the zen literature reveals as soon as an early zen master attained fame in seclusion he was called out into the world to exercise his powers the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles exponents of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of china and proposed instead a more mature less credulous view of the universe in support of this stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity hwang pah o baku one day going up mount tien tai which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats with supernatural powers met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light 	religion
205	there being no bridge the master had to stop at the shore but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow him thereupon hwang pah said if i knew thou art an arhat i would have doubled you up before thou got over there the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah and praised him as a true mahayanist a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess on one occasion yang shan kyozan saw a stranger monk flying through the air 	religion
206	 early this morning replied the other i set out from india  why said the teacher art thou so late  i stopped responded the man several times to look at beautiful sceneries  thou mayst have supernatural powers exclaimed yang shan yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me then the monk praised yang shan saying i have come over to china in order to worship manjucri and met unexpectedly with minor shakya and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india went back through the air 	religion
207	a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes to the zen monk the universe is still populated with spiritual beings who have to be appeased part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings modern zen presentation to the west insists on the antiauthoritarian highly pragmatic nature of the zen belief scriptures are burned to make fire action is based on direct selfconfidence and so on this picture of extreme selfreliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such zendo formulas as o you demons and other spiritual beings i now offer this to you and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith 	religion
208	a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading pope pius the sixth at rome in april #### wrote the following the faithful should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures for these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times the american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore urged the catholic people to read the holy bible  we hope they said that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the holy scriptures they recommended also that at a fixed hour let the entire family be assembled for night prayers followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures 	religion
209	do not wonder that i said to thee you must be born again the new birth is necessary because god is holy but as the one who called you is holy be you also holy in all your behavior for it is written you shall be holy because i am holy holiness without which no man will see god 	religion
210	as it is written there is not one just man all have sinned and have need of the glory of god the new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned you also when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins 	religion

217	and that which is born of the spirit is spirit do not wonder that i said to thee you must be born again for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account if then any man is in christ he is a new creature literally he is a new creation the former things have passed away for by grace you have been saved through faith 	religion

227	they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following to me the explanation is very simple i am not doing anything of myself it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness even when they turn away from it it is the power that holds the stars in their orbits but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass 	religion
228	it is mankinds wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace all things are possible to god but he chooses usually to work through people sometimes such people sense that they are being used fifteen years ago troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the postwar world a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women regardless of creed or color could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living neither had any publishing experience but they had faith in their idea 	religion
229	compared to the big established magazines my first efforts seemed feeble indeed but from the start they had two important ingredients sincerity and realism the people who told the stories were sincere for example early in my life when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of new yorks downandouters he didnt just ask questions len lesourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days 	religion

236	but you see those who are not mentioned will not resent it that is the kind of people they are perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs a little sanctimonious serious yes but also much laughter sharp division of opinion too and strenuous debate 	religion
237	and there is also something intangible that hovers around the table each meeting starts with a prayer offered spontaneously by one member of the group it takes many forms this prayer but in essence it is always a request for guidance for open minds and gentle hearts for honesty and sincerity for the wisdom and the insights that will help guideposts readers for you readers are an allimportant part of the spiritual experiment that is guideposts i need your support your criticism your encouragement your prayers 	religion

240	i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana within a week however i began to suspect that something was wrong for castro was bringing cuba not freedom but hatred he spent long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge he showed us how he dealt with his enemies he executed them before tv cameras 	religion

242	a suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist in my mind i began to review his use of hate to gain support his division of society into two classes one the hero the other the villain but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the palace what should i do about it i asked myself 	religion

259	only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country it must express the nations own will and goal nevertheless we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing first we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs 	government
260	third we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the countrys objectives and resources this includes assistance in assembling the basic economic financial technological and educational information on which programing depends surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy such as transport agriculture communication industry and power designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established 	government
261	it must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions to insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth in the more primitive areas where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available thus we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs in such a case however we would encourage the recipient country to get on with its programing task supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the countrys development was conditional upon programing progress being made 	government
262	a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of selfhelp it is vitally important that the new us aid program should encourage all of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves external aid can only be marginal although the margin as in the case of the marshall plan can be decisive external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to selfhelp us aid therefore should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take 	government
263	open societies can take many forms and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals on the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a countrys development potential we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur the major areas of selfhelp are the following a the effective mobilizing of resources this includes not only development programing but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment 	government
264	and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few  b the reduction of dependence on external sources this includes foreseeing balanceofpayments crises with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports it also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed  c tapping the energies of the entire population 	government
265	otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability in many societies what we regard as corruption favoritism and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources if dishonesty corruption and favoritism are widespread moreover tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates antiamerican sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest some of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification correct or not of communist regimes with personal honesty and prowestern regimes with corruption 	government
266	the united states can use its aid as an incentive to selfhelp by responding with aid on a sustained basis tailored to priority needs to those countries making serious efforts in selfhelp in many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts there are other countries where with skillful diplomacy we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth but there will be still other countries where despite the inadequacy of the level of selfhelp we shall deem it wise for political or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance even in these cases we should promote selfhelp by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination 	government
267	to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion most of our aid will go to those nearing selfsufficiencyhow long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country in several significant cases such as india a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no governmenttogovernment assistance these cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance 	government
268	the number of countries thus favorably situated is small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world meantime over the decade of the sixties we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into selfsustaining growth in still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible the whole program must be conceived of as an effort stretching over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world it must be recognized as a slowacting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in laos and cuba 	government
269	 a the need to budget a period of years many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods dams river development schemes transportation networks educational systems require years to construct moreover on complex projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence thus as a development program is being launched commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year 	government
270	 b the need to plan investment programs more importantly several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least # years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence without such forward planning investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed  c the need to allocate country resources 	government
271	they must be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory policies they must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary selfhelp measures which are described in the preceding section the taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions moreover once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves felt they must therefore be related to longrange development plans 	government
272	in this as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones the extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources to set targets toward which they should be working to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves all on a realistic longterm basis will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them if they feel that we are taking a longterm view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably longterm association with them in their development activities they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with longterm commitments you have heard him tell these young people that during his almost ## years of service in the congress he has seen the kaisers and the hitlers and the mussolinis the tojos and stalins and khrushchevs come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest nation that mankind has ever known 	government
273	so i say mr speaker god bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the united states of america and the free world you remember the words of president kennedy a week or so ago when someone asked him when he was in canada and dean rusk was in europe and vice president johnson was in asia who is running the store and he said the same fellow who has been running it sam rayburn mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record and also that they may have # legislative days in which to extend their remarks 	government
274	remarks of hon joseph p addabbo of new yorkit is notably significant that so many members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved speaker the honorable sam rayburn i purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the state of texas i did so because i agree with so many here today that he is the beloved speaker of all the people of the united states for the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative branch of our government it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country 	government
275	many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me and like many of you here present i hold as the highlight of all the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable speaker of the house at that time he afforded me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as i may need to speak about my background my hopes my views on various national and local topics and any problems that i may have been vexed with at the time he was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel in conclusion he wished me well and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself he asked to be remembered to my wife and children 	government
276	he is most effective in the ordinary business of the house and in the legislative accomplishments of this session he easily rose to great occasion even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle and as the nation witnessed these contests he rose even as admitted by those who differed with him to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan i am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant he will ever be my example as a true statesman one who is thoroughly human who affects no dignity and who is endowed with real ability genuine worth and sterling honesty all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long may the divine speaker in heaven bless this country with sam rayburns continued service here for years to come 	government
277	in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the stabilizing force that he represents in current american government is an almost indispensable source of strength he has become in this half century the grand old man of american history it seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to providence that sam rayburns vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades here briefly in this humble tribute i have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country but the task is beyond me because i hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions sam rayburn has made as an individual as a legislator as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this nation 	government
278	what sam rayburns life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of ones own community ones own district ones own state and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time for sam rayburn never forgot bonham his home community and he never forgot texas in the same way i like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community our district our state and if we follow the rayburn pattern as consciously or by an instinctual political sense i like to think i have followed it then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country for what sam rayburns life in this house teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district 	government
279	this may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson sam rayburns career up to this hour teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government more than that sam rayburn is the very living symbol of an ironclad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition through the most rancorous battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility sam rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions it is an answer in its way individual and highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics 	government
280	it is i insist hard to define the rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes so deep but this we know here is a great life that in every area of american politics gives the american people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor decency and selfrespect i pray to god that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the united states and the whole world can ill afford to lose all but two of my nine terms in the house of representatives has been served under the speakership of sam rayburn i have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carries his greatness 	government
281	he will be considered not only great among his contemporaries but as great among all the americans who have played a part in the countrys history since the beginning i pay my personal tribute to sam rayburn stalwart texan and great american not only because today he establishes a record of having served as speaker of the house of representatives more than twice as long as henry clay but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half century of service as a member of congress speaker rayburn has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the house in the speakers chair he had an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the house in #### the ##d congress no one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has sam rayburn 	government
282	but to run the gauntlet of the programs sam rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of todays record no greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this house than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great speaker this great legislator this great texan this great american my sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today sam rayburn is one of the greatest american public figures in the history of our country and i consider that i have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing sam rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a member of the house of representatives in the congress of the united states others may speak of speaker rayburns uniquely long and devoted service 	government
283	i prefer to speak however of sam rayburn the person rather than sam rayburn the american institution although sam rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition no one could be more devoted than he to the american congress as an institution and more aware of its historical significance in the political history of the world and i shall never forget his moving talks delivered in simple yet eloquent words upon the meaning of our jobs as representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of todays assault upon popular government above all he is a person to whom a fledgling representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new congressman in this role of father confessor he has always been most characteristic and most helpful 	government
284	the practice of stateowned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years at least one state vehicle was in existence in #### the state presently owns ### passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately ### in #### the automobile maintenance unit or motor pool came into existence in #### and has been responsible for centralized maintenance and management of stateowned transportation since that time the motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems records keeping analyses of vehicle use and effecting economies in vehicle operation 	government
285	purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes the legislatures role in policy determination concerning stateowned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to appropriating funds for vehicles the meaningful policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the states administrative officers meaningful policies include a kinds of cars the state should own b when cars should be traded c the need and assignment of vehicles d use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances e employees taking cars home and f need for liability insurance on state automobiles 	government
286	the state purchases and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle the purchase of compact economy cars is being made currently on a test basis cars are traded mostly on a threeyear basis in the interest of economy the factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles 	government
287	the state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars a survey of practices and/or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with rhode islands practices fortyseven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business two other states provide vehicles but only with legislative approval states which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency the individual or to a central pool 	government
288	nineteen states report laws policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances of these states the average changeover point at which a car is substituted for allowances is ##### miles per year mileage allowances for state employees are of two types a actual mileage and b fixed monthly allowances actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personallyowned vehicles on state business at the rate of $## per mile fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a nonitemized basis 	government
289	rhode islands reimburseable rate of $## per mile for use of personallyowned cars compares favorably with other states rates the average of states rates is $### per mile rhode islands rate of $## per mile is considerably lower than reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a $## per mile average actual mileage allowances are welladministered and not unduly expensive for the state the travel regulations requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive 	government
290	however they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures flat payments over $## per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of stateowned vehicles travel allowances including subsistence have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other states allowances with few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and $## per day subsistence travel allowances are wellregulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control 	government
291	few records are available concerning the subject prior to #### the registry of motor vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as #### it should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old the best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the ####s and ##s at that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties 	government
292	once the principle was established the increase in stateowned vehicles came rapidly and reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth table # immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees this rate of increase does not signify anything in itself it does not indicate loose management ineffective controls or poor policy 	government
293	in the past twenty years the ratio of stateowned automobiles per state employees has varied from # to ## then to # to ## now whether there were too few automobiles in #### or too many now is problematical the fact is simply that stateowned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them while the origin of stateowned automobiles may be obscured subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly prior to #### automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned 	government
294	in #### however the nation was at war the state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual it met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit more popularly called the motor pool a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation the motor pool then as now had headquarter facilities in providence and other garages located throughout the state it was organizationally the responsibility of the department of public works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pools operation 	government
295	the management of stateowned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made the agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the costbilling system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis one indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period ######## while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased ##% the total maintenance cost increased only ##% 	government
296	the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles  note so far as state police cars are concerned only their replacement is under this division this tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade stateowned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs in light of depreciation become excessive moreover it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet for example if one driver puts on ##### miles per year and another driver #### miles per year their cars will be switched so that both cars will have ##### miles after two years rather than ##### miles and related higher maintenance costs and ##### miles respectively 	government
297	it handles all types of vehicle maintenance but concentrates more on service station activities than on extensive vehicle repairs it contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and costdata studies and analyses pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be traded for sound economies from this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data 	government
298	based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of ##### miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personallyowned vehicles they estimate further that with sufficient experience and when costdata of compact cars is compiled the breakeven point may be reduced to #### miles of travel per year table # shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities present pool quarters at two locations in providence are crowded antiquated and in general make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment 	government
299	the purchase of stateowned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made bids are evaluated by the division of purchases with the assistance of pool staff and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public the reasons are obvious # the state is buying in quantity and # it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay 	government
300	in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier this is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately costaccounting principles the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles the legislatures role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles 	government
301	there was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years at the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well thus there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and in addition must give assistance to its local governments 	government
302	consequently there have developed several forms of grantsinaid and shared taxes as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level notwithstanding state aid the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax this is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored taxation of tangible movable property in rhode island has been generally of a hands off nature due possibly to several reasons # local assessors in the main are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs # the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult and # the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property among the many problems in the taxing of personal property and of movable tangible property in particular two are significant # situs # fair and equitable assessment of value 	government
303	although the laws of the various states in general specify the situs of property ie residence or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exceptions regarding boats airplanes mobile homes etc seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment rhode island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated it also provides for the taxation of all personal property belonging to inhabitants of the state both tangible and intangible and the tangible personal property of nonresidents in this state in defining personal property it specifically mentions all ships or vessels at home or abroad intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year 	government
304	this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on december ## both boats and aircraft would fall within this category as well as motor vehicles the location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged obviously it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the ##st day of december in view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft 	government
305	this situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably justifiably middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that all rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ## months next preceding the first day of april in each year the smithfield tax assessor in turn claims the tax under the provision of law and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated this problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors who in general are nonprofessional and parttime personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem this accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in rhode island 	government
306	the rhode island public expenditure council in its publication once commented the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the state take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property an adequately staffed and equipped state assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the state a single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of ## different and independent assessing units the institute of public administration in its report to the state fiscal study commission in #### recommended consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job 	government
307	to determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in rhode island the replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case there are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town these opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time in reply to a question of whether they now tax boats airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not 	government
308	one assessor checked boats only another trailers and tractors one mentioned house trailers and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type in two cases airplanes only were indicated it is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation but the conclusion may be drawn that ## towns do not assess movable personal property and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats it would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property 	government
309	only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership fifteen stated that it was according to location four by residence of the owner and nineteen did not answer twentyseven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property and only five were opposed on this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now 	government
310	another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides of those who have an opinion it seems that assessment by location is preferred there was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date to summarize it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge 	government
311	interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats assessors in rhode island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting it has been obvious to the assessors particularly those in shore communities that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach through their professional organization the rhode island tax officials association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed no satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors 	government
312	it is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation it is known that at least five towns barrington bristol narragansett newport and westerly place some value on some boats for tax purposes however few are taxed and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations no one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be slightly more than #### boats were registered with the coast guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law 	government
313	the assessors association meeting at narragansett in september #### devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem local industrys investment in rhode island was the big story in ####s industrial development effort fiftytwo companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction totaling ####### square feet and representing an investment of $######## with minor exceptions this expansion was instituted either by firms based in rhode island or outofstate manufacturers already operating here what made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although #### was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation rhode island scored marked progress in new industry new plants and new jobs 	government

317	we also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of rhode island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here to reach a still greater audience of locationminded manufacturers our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from $##### to $##### and the industrial building authoritys financial participation was upped from $##### to $##### newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the new york times and the wall street journal eastern and midwestern editions which averaged two prominent ads per month and to a lesser degree the new york herald tribune and for the west coast the los angeles times and the wall street journal pacific coast edition in addition to the regular schedule advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the new york times boston herald american banker electronic news and for local promotion the providence sunday journal magazine advertising included management methods the new englander u s investor and plant location 	government

323	these objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the planning division first priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state recognizing the truth of the statement by the institute of public administration that metropolian planning in rhode island means or should mean state planning the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of rhode islands problems it will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government to this end the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available on a shared cost basis technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff 	government
324	among the operating departments of the state between the cities and towns of the state and on a regional basis between the six new england states on the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources plans for the provision of essential services such as water will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries within the framework of the state plan the state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan 	government
325	functionally the planning division carries out four activities longrange state planning current state planning local planning assistance and the preparation of the state development budget the planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation the longrange aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases basic mapping inventory analysis and plan and policy formation the work program as it was originally proposed was to take five years to complete 	government
326	the basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion july # #### since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program the first step taken by the planning division to implement the longrange state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps one at a scale of # inch to a mile and the second a series of ## sheets at a scale of # inch to #### feet covering the entire state with these maps completed the inventory phase of the plan has been started with the aid of matching federal funds available under section ### of the housing act of #### as amended the planning division began a one year program july # #### to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program this phase consists of four items urban land use rural land use physical features and public utility service areas 	government
327	the urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning the rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the university of rhode island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use the mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and like the other two inventory projects are scheduled for completion july # #### the collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose it is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in rhode island 	government
328	there are fortyseven special district governments in rhode island excluding two regional school districts four housing authorities and the kent county water authority these fortyseven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes to borrow money own property sue and be sued and in general to exercise normal corporate powers unlike cities and towns however they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state bureau of audits it is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government in addition to the collection of service charges the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $###### 	government
329	fortysix states including rhode island end their fiscal year on june ## the other four states end on varying dates alabama sept ## new york march ## pennsylvania may ## and texas august ## in sixteen states the fiscal year ending of the cities june ## is the same as that of the state alaska arizona california delaware massachusetts montana nevada new mexico north carolina north dakota oklahoma oregon vermont west virginia wyoming and hawaii in eleven states the fiscal year of the cities ends on december ## while the state fiscal year ends on june ## arkansas colorado indiana kansas new hampshire new jersey ohio south dakota utah washington and wisconsin in eight states whose fiscal years close on june ## a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on december ## 	government
330	one state alabama closes its fiscal year on september ## and all cities in the state with one exception also close fiscal years on september ## mississippi closes its fiscal year on june ## while all of its cities close their fiscal years on september ## pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on may ## all of its cities close their fiscal years on december ## the remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state city and local governments 	government
331	an excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently he listed among the values of fiscal uniformity # the uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spending the uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn it enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts 	government
332	by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set on expenditures the uniform fiscal year brings the towns fiscal year into line with that of the schools which expend the largest share of local disbursements this greatly simplifies the towns bookkeeping and financial reporting the uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes furthermore tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in shortterm treasury notes augmenting the towns miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy 	government
333	when towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons and as the cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also increases towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare of all advantages probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times 	government
334	in any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs heavy when shortterm money rates are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most this type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year 	government
335	both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below it has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization and the statelocal sharing of responsibility for certain important functions this is no longer true the haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient statelocal revenue and expenditure relationships although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in rhode island there are also certain difficulties encountered 	government
336	one problem is a matter of shifting dates the other is how to finance the transition little can be done about the changing of dates this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars it usually means a confused and disgruntled taxpaying public for a period of time 	government
337	the other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns it should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city fortunately there are no cities or towns in the state with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change sacrifice will have to be made in some cases but it is to the municipalitys advantage to finance the changeover for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for rhode island municipalities to exert effort to secure them 	government
338	first the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula second the shift to a uniform july # to june ## fiscal year will of itself improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns there are at least two problems to consider one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary the latter matter is considered in detail in a later section 	government
339	plans vary from the talking stage to establishing special committees to accomplish this end what is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them an analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought however it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved the adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout rhode island based on a july # to june ## year are shown below 	government
340	these municipalities include barrington lincoln middletown newport north kingstown and south kingstown one town and one city coventry and east providence require an adjustment of their fiscal year only this change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year six cities and towns are now on a july # to june ## fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity these cities and towns include bristol glocester pawtucket cumberland central falls and woonsocket 	government
341	both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars however neither of these two cities is on the desired july # to june ## fiscal year the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them in that both cities end their fiscal years on september ## they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months commencing with september ## and ending with june ## these three installment dates would be october ## january ## and april ## providence and november ## february ## and may ## cranston 	government
342	their tax collection calendar could then be july ## october ## january ## and april ## providence and august ## november ## february ## and may ## cranston under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods the remaining twentythree towns have fiscal years which end prior to june ## all of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years 	government
343	aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary it should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements in many communities there is simply no financial problem it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques in other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes 	government
344	as shown earlier in table # the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars in addition no two rhode island communities are identical in relation to their overall financial condition these factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars the financial condition of the treasuries and the length of the transition interval suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from shortterm serial notes to longterm bonds 	government
345	for those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the problem rhode island heritage week proclamation by john a notte jr governorthe theme of rhode island heritage week for #### will be independence and union it commemorates the ###th anniversary of rhode islands independence when upon may # #### the general assembly by its action established the first free republic in the new world as this year marks the centennial of the beginning of the civil war this fact is being commemorated with several exhibits throughout the state but most of all paying tribute to the first rhode island volunteers who rushed to the defense of the city of washington putting at the disposal of president lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time 	government

377	in addition their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated air force medical bulletin estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the journal and bulletin on a triservice basis as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service were between $##### and $##### additionally on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations the availability of the journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage from # july #### to ## june #### ## numbers of the journal and nine of the bulletin were published each journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest and departments devoted to military medical news reviews of new books and other features of interest to officers of the medical services 	government
378	beginning with the october #### issue of the journal the method of production of copy for photooffset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting this resulted in an improved appearance but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds the use of ### instead of ### substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the may #### issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly $#### in unexpended funds two special issues were published one for november #### on space medicine the other the tenth anniversary issue for january #### the february #### issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled the medical officer writes 	government

380	this work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method and raises this property to ## percent above that accepted a few years ago similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride the development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion in one of these an explodingwire device to study systems thermodynamically up to #### af and ### atmospheres pressure a major goal was achieved the accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than # percent 	government
381	the method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter the element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy this is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element a highspeed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion the shutter consists of two parts a fastopening part and a fastclosing part 	government
382	the fastopening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil approximately af placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera the opening action is obtained when a capacitor charged to high voltage is suddenly discharged through the foil during the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line thus allowing light to pass into the camera experiments have shown that the shutter is ## percent open in about #### microseconds the shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil 	government
383	the detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and perhaps planetary atmospheres among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides oh and ch somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides sh sih and aj very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable in interstellar gas concentrations as low as af molecules per af may be sufficient as compared to the af hydrogen atoms af required for detection of the ##cm line 	government
384	therefore only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible to secure precise measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead this involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor which shifts the lowfrequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity the first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the oh radical 	government
385	the frequencies are ###### and ###### af with an uncertainty of ### af success in observing these spectral lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory preparations are being made for similar experiments on ch and sh radicals the bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range ## to ## af the efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors and helium# vaporpressure measurements see p ### 	government
386	such an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer when values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium# vapor pressures differences of about ## and # millidegrees respectively were found this result is preliminary and work is continuing carbon resistors and impuritydoped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from ### to ## af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within #/# millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium 	government
387	the estimated standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were # millidegree and for the third resistor ## millidegrees the reproducibilities of helium vaporpressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath from ## to ## af surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in ## and ##liter metallic storage dewars the gradient was about one half of a millidegree at ## af but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point 	government
388	however the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vaporpressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb from the liquid helium surface it has also been observed in helium # that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer this has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow precise pressurevolumetemperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer 	government
389	the transducer is a nulltype instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm #### in thick and # in in diameter a small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced #### in apart for af spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit over a temperature range from ## to ### af and at pressures up to ### atm an overload of ### psi applied for a period of one day results in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter of mercury a #year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed 	government
390	a significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present the results of the study based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity thermal conductivity thermal diffusion and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of #### to ##### af and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from af to af times normal density in march #### representatives of the national laboratories of australia canada the netherlands united kingdom ussr united states and west germany met at the nbs to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between ## and ## af as a first step toward this goal arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory 	government

409	yesterday i had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the us news & world report of may # which discussed this type of action in more detail including both its advantages and its disadvantages under leave to extend my remarks i include the relevant portion of my newsletter together with the text of the article from the us news & world report your congressman samuel s stratton reports from washington may # ####cuban ssr whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the castroheld mainland last week there was at least one positive benefit and that was the clearcut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russiandominated military base in fact one of the major reasons for the failure of the illstarred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which cuba has been getting this russian military equipment somehow the pictures and stories of soviet t## tanks on cuban beaches and russian mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark blunt truth of what it means to have a russian military base ## miles away from home 	government
410	once the full extent of this russian military penetration of cuba was clear president kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this even if we had to go it alone but the latin american republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing cuba off the interamerican defense board for years the united states had been trying to get these countries to exclude castros representative from secret military talks but it took the pictures of the migs and the t## tanks to do the job there is a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week 	government
411	efforts as i see it which are being directed by the way toward support for future actions not for those already past what the next move will be only time of course will tell personally i think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of cuba we simply cant tolerate further russian weapons including the possibility of longrange nuclear missiles being located in cuba obviously we cant stop them from coming in however just by talk 	government
412	 from us news & world report may # #### next for cuba an arms blockade look at castro now cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the americas in it they see a way to isolate cuba stop infiltration maybe finish castro too this is the question now facing president kennedy how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to communist infiltration of this hemisphere 	government
413	its aim to undermine further cubas economy another strategy bolder and tougher was also attracting notice in washington a naval and air blockade to cut cuba off from the world destroy castro blockade in the view of military and civilian experts could restore teeth to the monroe doctrine it could halt a flood of communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching castro it could stop cuban reexport of guns and propaganda materials to south america 	government
414	it is the strategy of blockade therefore that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials members of congress officers in the pentagon as a possible course of action it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions among these questions what would a cuba blockade take military experts say a tight naval blockade off cuban ports and at the approaches to cuban waters would require two naval task forces each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about ### planes and several destroyers the navy on april ## announced it is bringing back the carrier shangrila from the mediterranean increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of cuba 	government
415	to round out the blockading force submarines would be needed to locate identify and track approaching vessels a squadron of navy jets and another of longrange patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces three requirements go with a blockade it must be proclaimed the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it once these conditions of international law are met countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk 	government
416	they could be sent to us ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated in a broad sense it would reaffirm the monroe doctrine by opposing communist interference in the western hemisphere it could by avoiding direct intervention provide a shortofwar strategy to meet shortofwar infiltration primary target would be shipments of tanks guns aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from russia and czechoslovakia shipments of arms from western countries could similarly be seized as contraband 	government
417	at times three ships a day from the soviet bloc are unloading in cuban ports from its inception in #### with the passage of public law ### ##th congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the states by means of grantsinaid to return disabled men and women to productive gainful employment the authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as title # of the social security act in #### up to this time and for the next eight years the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training counseling and placement on a job recognizing the limitations of such a program the ##th congress in #### passed p l ### which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities and which revised the financing structure 	government
418	to assist the states therefore in rehabilitating handicapped individuals so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities the ##rd congress enacted the vocational rehabilitation amendments of #### p l ### these amendments to the vocational rehabilitation act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities for more sheltered and halfway workshops for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel for more comprehensive services to individuals particularly to the homebound and the blind and for other administrative improvements to increase the programs overall effectiveness under the law as it existed until #### the federal government made grants to the states on the basis of population matching state expenditures on a #### basis under p l ### ##th congress the federal government assumed responsibility for ###% of necessary state expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled and for ##% of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services throughout these years the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the act 	government
419	and # research demonstrations training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation and in addition for shortterm training and instruction the first part of the new structure that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services is described in this section subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure the following table shows for selected years the authorizations appropriations allotment base federal grants to states and state matching funds for this part of the grant program in order to assist the states in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services section # of the amended act provides that allotments to states for support of such services be based on # need as measured by a states population and # fiscal capacity as measured by its per capita income 	government
420	it stipulates in addition that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the ceiling and not used for insuring the floor be redistributed to those states still below their maximums these provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the states with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a state with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated state the provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in state programs already in operation which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone the method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the act the term state means the several states the district of columbia the virgin islands guam and puerto rico 	government
421	the following steps are employed in calculations # for each state except puerto rico guam the virgin islands and prior to #### alaska and hawaii determine average per capita income based on the last three years  see source of data below for per capita income data to be used in this step determine the average per capita income for the u s based on the last three years  see source of data below for per capita income data to be used in this step 	government
422	determine for each state except the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior to #### alaska and hawaii that percentage which bears the same ratio to ##% as the particular states average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the u s  multiply the result obtained in item # above by the result obtained for each state in item # above determine the particular states allotment percentage by law this is ##% for the virgin islands guam and puerto rico  alaska and hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year #### 	government
423	except that no state shall have an allotment percentage less than ###/#% nor more than ##% if the resulting difference for the particular state is less or more than these extremes the states allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme  see source of data below for population data to be used in this step multiply the population of each state by the square of its allotment percentage  multiply result obtained in item # above by result obtained in item # above 	government
424	 for each state make all computations set forth in items # to # above and then add the results obtained for each state in item # determine the ratio that the amount being allotted is to the sum of the products for all the states  divide the amount being allotted by the result obtained in item # above determine the particular states unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year  multiply the state product in item # above by the result obtained in item ## above 	government
425	 each states unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item ## below by a percentage greater than one and onehalf times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $######## must be reduced by the amount of the excess determine if the particular states unadjusted allotment result obtained in item ## above is less than its minimum base allotment and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment regardless of its unadjusted allotment each state is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year #### increased by a uniform percentage of ######## which brings total #### allotments to all states up to $######## the funds recouped by reductions in item ## above are used first to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those states where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment item ## above and second to increase uniformly the allotments to those states whose allotments are below their maximums with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceeding its maximum 	government
426	funds allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine as is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula prior to #### in order to provide matching for the minimum base allotment state funds had to equal #### state funds prior to and since #### the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the state with a pivot of ##% state or ##% federal participation in total program costs the percentage of federal participation in such costs for any state is referred to in the law as that states federal share 	government
427	beginning in #### the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted upward or downward as required ##% a year so that by #### the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a ##% pivot state share with maximum and minimum state shares of ##% and ##% respectively the pre#### rate of federal participation with respect to any states base allotment as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the #### #### period is designated by the statute as that states adjusted federal share the provisions for determining a states unadjusted federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the states the purpose of the adjusted federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates the method used for computing the respective federal and state shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the act 	government
428	the term united states includes the several states and the district of columbia and excludes the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior to #### alaska and hawaii the following steps are employed in the calculations # for each state except the virgin islands guam puerto rico and prior to #### alaska and hawaii determine the average per capita income for the last three years  the same amount used in item # under method of computing allotments above determine the average per capita income for the united states for the last three years 	government
429	determine the ratio of ##% to the average per capita income of the united states  divide ## by the amount used in item # above determine for each state except the virgin islands guam puerto rico and prior to #### alaska and hawaii that percentage which bears the same ration to ##% as the particular states average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the united states  multiply the result obtained in item # above by the amount used for each state in item # above determine the particular states federal share 	government
430	 alaska and hawaii had fixed federal share percentages in effect prior to fiscal year #### in all other states it is the difference obtained by subtracting from ### the result obtained in item # above except that no state shall have a federal share less than ##% nor more than ##% if the resulting difference for the particular state is less or more than these extremes the states federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme at the entrance side of the shelter each roof beam is rested on the inside # inches of the block wall 	government
431	the wooden bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall mortar is poured between this bracing and the #inch blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding  for details see inset fig # the first one or two roof boards marked e in fig # are slipped into place across the roof beams from outside the shelter these boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams from inside the shelter 	government
432	the roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together work on the roof continues in this way the last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter when the roof blocks are all in place the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and dense are used for this shelter 	government
433	solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection if they are used the walls and roof should be ## inches thick to give the same protection as the #inch solid concrete blocks the illustrations in fig # show how to lay a concrete block wall more detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and craftsmen other sources of information include the national concrete masonry association ## south dearborn street chicago ill the portland cement association ## west grand avenue chicago ill and the structural clay products association washington dc 	government
434	 most people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter this shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface making it impractical to build an underground shelter two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at least ## inches apart the space between them is filled with pitrun gravel or earth the walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built 	government
435	an alternate roof perhaps more within doityourself reach could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams overlaid with boards and waterproofing it would have to be covered with at least ## inches of pitrun gravel the materials for a doublewall shelter would cost about $### the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection preshaped corrugated metal sections or precast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground 	government
436	they form effective fallout shelters when mounded over with earth as shown in figure ## materials for this shelter would cost about $### a contractor probably would be required to help build it his charges would be added to the cost of materials this shelter as shown on page ## would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation 	government
437	the national lumber manufacturers association washington d c is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction the structural clay products institute washington dc is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction an underground reinforced concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $#### to $#### depending on the type of entrance the shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection the illustration fig ## shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over 	government
438	plans for the shelter with either a stairway or hatchway entrance are shown on pages ## and ## another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction it would add about $### to the total cost of the home the shelter illustrated in figure ## is based on such a room built in a new home in the washington dc area in the spring of #### important considerations common to each type of shelter are # 	government
439	therefore sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance a blower may be installed to increase comfort a blower is essential for the doublewall shelter and for the underground shelters it should provide not less than # cubic feet per minute of air per person 	government
440	radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation as soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made it probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive conelrad broadcasts continuous lowlevel lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a #cell hotshot battery to which is wired a ###milliampere flashlighttype bulb tests have shown that such a device with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least ## days 	government
441	a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed there should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas  if there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter they should be shielded as shown in the appendix page ## other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the appendix page ## 	government
442	bunks or materials to build them may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed the basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection the radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first fortynine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about # percent of what it was an hour after the explosion but the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous 	government
443	radiation instruments suitable for home use are available and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation there is a possibility that batterypowered radios with builtin radiation meters may become available your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from state and federal sources it will tell you as soon as possible how long to stay in your shelter 	government
444	a checklist in the appendix page ## tells what is needed there should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake to break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy the survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio 	government
445	blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement however as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum the housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied food medical supplies utensils and equipment if not already stored in the shelter must be quickly gathered up and carried into it 	government
446	sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem a covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet a ##gallon garbage can with a tightly fitting cover could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully 	government
447	it would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning even if the electric power fails after an attack any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature warm clothing and bedding of course are essential some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need 	government
448	few areas if any are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about a family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation on the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside the best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house a belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to onetenth of the outside level 	government
449	if there is time after the warning the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking windows with bricks dirt books magazines or other heavy material large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings in general such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space the central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building with concrete floors should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling the basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling 	government
450	the problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management a former du pont official became a general motors vice president and set about maximizing du ponts share of the general motors market lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du pont products were actively promoted within a few years various du pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of general motors eight operating divisions 	government
451	competitors came to receive higher percentage of general motors business in later years but it is likely that this trend stemmed at least in part from the needs of general motors outstripping du ponts capacity the fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du ponts production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du pont by a stock interest the inference is overwhelming that du ponts commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit this court agreed with the trial court that considerations of price quality and service were not overlooked by either du pont or general motors however it determined that neither this factor nor the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone including du ponts competitors outweighed the governments claim for relief 	government
452	the latter provisions proscribe any contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and monopolization of or attempts combinations or conspiracies to monopolize such trade however this court put to one side without consideration the governments appeal from the dismissal of its sherman act allegations it rested its decision solely on # which reads in pertinent part no corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition or to restrain such commerce in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce this section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about the substantial lessening of competition 	government
453	section # is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which as a reasonable probability appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation the section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies or the substantial lessening of competition have occurred or are intended thus a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the courts decision indeed as already noted the court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du pont and general motors acted honorably and fairly and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies this however did not bar finding that du pont had become preeminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to general motors 	government
454	that general motors share of the market for these products was substantial and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns the statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customers stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute we repeat that the test of a violation of # is whether at the time of suit there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints the conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition 	government
455	the sole guidance given the court for discharging the task committed to it was this the judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the district court for a determination after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute the district courts in the framing of equitable decrees are clothed with large discretion to model their judgements to fit the exigencies of the particular case international salt co v united states ### u s ### ###### this brings us to the course of the proceedings in the district court 	government
456	the first pretrial conference held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of du pont and general motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings took place on september ## #### at the outset the governments spokesman explained that counsel for the government and for du pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court du pont he said had proposed disenfranchisement of its general motors stock along with other restrictions on the du pont general motors relationship the government deeming these suggestions inadequate had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du ponts shares of general motors counsel for the government invited du ponts views on this proposal before recommending a specific program but stated that if the court desired or if counsel for du pont thought further discussion would not be profitable the government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days 	government
457	no previous antitrust case he said had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief the submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract the court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out the government submitted its proposed decree on october ## #### the plan called for divestiture by du pont of its ######## shares of general motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders as a dividend over a period of ten years 	government
458	if in the trustees judgment reasonable market conditions did not prevail during any given year he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the tenyear period in addition the right to vote the general motors stock held by du pont was to be vested in du ponts stockholders other than christiana and delaware and the stockholders of delaware du pont christiana and delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over general motors du pont christiana and delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with general motors and vice versa and general motors and du pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by general motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du pont manufactured product or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by general motors to du pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of general motors or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies 	government
459	on may # #### the commissioner announced his rulings the annual dividends paid to du pont stockholders in shares of general motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du ponts earnings and profits the measure for federal income tax purposes of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution in the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or du ponts tax basis for them which is approximately $### per share the forced sale of the general motors stock owned by or allocable to christiana delaware and the stockholders of delaware and deposited with the trustee would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate 	government
460	under its plan du pont would retain its general motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares christiana and delaware would in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the general motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders du pont would be enjoined from having as a director officer or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of general motors and no director officer or employee of du pont could serve as a director of general motors without court approval du pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional general motors stock except through general motors distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders on june # #### general motors submitted its objections to the governments proposal 	government
461	that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies that the tremendous volume of general motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of general motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity general motors comprehensively contended that the government plan would not be in the public interest as required by the mandate of this court the decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed in august of #### 	government
462	both plans also prohibited common directors officers or employees between du pont christiana and delaware on the one hand and general motors on the other it is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude unnourished by sense to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship while it is easy enough to ridicule hawkins pronouncement in pleas of the crown from a metaphysical point of view the concept of the oneness of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage by making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which congress has afforded to the marriage relationship the court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in wyatt v united states ### us ### where the court held that under the circumstances of that case a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection one need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in american life which are also of great importance and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself 	government
463	the courts opinion dogmatically asserts that the husbandwife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine enthrones an unreality into a rule of law i am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed but in any event i submit that the power to depose belongs to congress not to this court petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector was convicted of violating ##a of the universal military training and service act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces he claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the fifth amendment because # at a hearing before a hearing officer of the department of justice he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board and # at the trial he was denied the right to have the hearing officers report and the original report of the federal bureau of investigation as to his claim 	government
464	petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings because the statement in question was in his file to which he had access and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the department of justice and before the appeal board petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officers notes and report especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the department of justices recommendation to the appeal board petitioner was not entitled either in the administrative hearing at the department of justice or at his trial to inspect the original report of the federal bureau of investigation since he was furnished a resume of it did not challenge its accuracy and showed no particular need for the original report haydn c covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner daniel m friedman argued the cause for the united states 	government
465	mr justice clark delivered the opinion of the court this is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed services in violation of the provisions of the universal military training and service act ## stat ###### ## usc app aj ### a petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector contends that he was denied due process both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the department of justice and at trial he says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board and further that he was denied at trial the right to have the department of justice hearing officers report and the original report of the federal bureau of investigation as to his claim all in violation of the fifth amendment the trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents 	government
466	we granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the act we have concluded that petitioners claims are controlled by the rationale of gonzales v united states ### us ### #### and united states v nugent ### us # #### and therefore affirm the judgment petitioner registered with local board no # boulder colorado on march ## #### his answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of jehovahs witnesses employed at night by a sugar producer he claimed #d classification as a minister of religion devoting a minimum of ### hours a month to preaching 	government
467	on november ## #### he wrote the board protesting this classification he again stated that he was a regular minister that he was devoting an average of ### hours a month to actual preaching publicly in addition to ## to ## hours in other ministerial duties and that he opposed war in any form on april # #### after some six months of fulltime pioneering petitioner discontinued devoting ### hours a month to preaching but failed to so notify his local board in a periodic review the local board on july ## #### reclassified him #a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home 	government
468	he was not prosecuted however and his case was subsequently reopened in the light of sicurella v united states ### us ### #### he was again reclassified #a by the local board there followed a customary department of justice hearing at which petitioner appeared in his report to the attorney general the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service on march ## #### however the department recommended approval of the #a classification 	government
469	it reported that he now devoted only some ##/# hours per month to public preaching and from ## to ## hours per month to church activities his claim was therefore so highly exaggerated the department concluded that it cast doubt upon his veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith the appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation in his answer thereto he advised the board that he had made no such statement in #### and asserted that his only claim to pioneering was in #### the appeal board however unanimously concurred in the departments recommendation 	government
470	petitioner first contends that the department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity before its final recommendation to the appeal board to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting ### hours to actual preaching but the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file he admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer this he failed to do asserting that he did not know it to be in his file apparently he never took the trouble to find out 	government
471	after the recommendation of the department is forwarded to the appeal board that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial we found in gonzales v united states supra that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant we said there that it was necessary that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut the departments recommendation when it comes to the appeal board the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification we fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioners contention which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it as was said in gonzales it is the appeal board which renders the selective service determination considered final in the courts not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact 	government
472	but there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult at his trial petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the departments hearing officer evensen as well as his report thereon petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original federal bureau of investigation reports to the department of justice he alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of investigation reports might disclose 	government
473	but there is nothing in the act requiring the hearing officers report to be likewise turned over to the registrant while the regulations formerly required that the hearing officers report be placed in the registrants file this requirement was eliminated in #### moreover the hearing officers report is but intradepartmental is directed to the attorney general and of course is not the recommendation of the department it is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of which the attorney general receives many and to which he may give his approval or rejection it is but part of the whole process within the department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board 	government
474	hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the department on file with the board petitioner knew that the departments recommendation was based not on the hearing officers report but on the statement of the local board in his file having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed it appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officers report and notes at the trial in addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes 	government
475	moreover his testimony at trial never developed any such facts in the light of these circumstances as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the departments recommendation which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record we find no relevancy in the hearing officers report and notes finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the fbi report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial he did receive a resume of it the same that was furnished the appeal board and he made no claim of its inaccuracy he bases his present contention on the general right to explore indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume 	government
476	there we held that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service system entitles [ conscientious objectors ] to no guarantee that the fbi reports must be produced for their inspection even if we were not bound by nugent petitioner here would not be entitled to the report the recommendation of the department as well as the decision of the appeal board was based entirely on the local board file not on an fbi report with this enlarged role in mind i should like to make a few suggestions what we in the united states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world we in this department must think about foreign policy in its total context 	government
477	foreign policy is the total involvement of the american people with peoples and governments abroad that means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must think in terms of the total context of our situation it is the concern of the department of state that the american people are safe and secure defense is not a monopoly concern of the department of defense it is also the concern of the department of state that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous profitable and active this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the department of commerce we can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve differences between this and other departments 	government
478	means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy i think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present the movement of events is so fast the pace so severe that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present 	government
479	action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control there will of course be times for delay and inaction what i am suggesting is that when we delay or when we fail to act we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties i also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas an affliction of all bureaucracies we want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the department 	government
480	i hope no one expects that only presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas the responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the department who has a policy function regardless of rank further i would hope that we could pay attention to little things while observing the operations of our government in various parts of the world i have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort to cite only a few examples the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior position abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy 	government
481	dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them i would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them if the department of state is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas this does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational interested responsible fashion 	government
482	he is expected to supervise to encourage to direct to assist in any way he can if any official operation abroad begins to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action it occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which i expressed privately in recent years in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside government i tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine 	government
483	his first thought is about the question itself is there a question here for american foreign policy and if so what is it for he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind he reaches a tentative identification of the question tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because if no tolerable answer can be found it may have to be changed into one which can be answered meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can never be complete and the general background much of which has already been lost to history he is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policyoriented conclusions 	government
484	he is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action including doing nothing he knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog but he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy wellestablished precedents the commitments of the united states under international charters and treaties basic statutes and wellunderstood notions of the american people about how we are to conduct ourselves in policy literature such as country papers and national security council papers accumulated in the department he will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted he must think about which of these principles must take precedence 	government
485	he is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole when the whole is too large to grasp he must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer who should be consulted among his colleagues in the department or other departments and agencies of the government which american ambassadors could provide helpful advice 	government
486	what is the probable attitude of other governments including those less directly involved how and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted if action is indicated what kind of action is relevant to the problem the selection of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself can the president or the secretary act under existing authority or will new legislation and new money be required 	government
487	is the matter one for the united nations or some other international body for if so the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem what type of action can hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it he is interested in public opinion for two reasons first because it is important in itself and second because he knows that the american public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind 	government
488	may i add a caution on this particular point we do not want policy officers below the level of presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action in the first place our business is foreign policy and it is the business of the presidential leadership and his appointees in the department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem mr truman emphasized this point by saying you fellows in the department of state dont know much about domestic politics if we sit here reading editorials and looking at publicopinion polls and other reports that cross our desks we should realize that this is raw undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership 	government
489	we cannot test public opinion until the president and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action i doubt for example that # months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the marshall plan any publicopinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals the problem in the policy officers mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors political military economic financial legal legislative procedural administrative to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control and the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels while there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women 	government
490	there should be no draft exemption because of peace corps service in most cases service in the corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment peace corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the united states nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid the guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services 	government
491	peace corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living they should live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts some special health requirements might have to be met for example it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers 	government
492	for readjustment to the us volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service based on the length of time served in what part of the government should the peace corps be established the idea of a peace corps has captured the imagination of a great many people support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines the peace corps therefore offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world an opportunity for the american people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development 	government
493	pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program the peace corps should be established as an agency in the department of state when the aid operations are reorganized the peace corps should remain a semiautonomous functional unit meanwhile the peace corps could be physically located in icas facilities and depend on the state department and ica for administrative support and when needed program assistance in this way the peace corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for united states foreign policy and our overseas operations how and when should the peace corps be launched 	government
494	the peace corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this years graduating classes will not be lost nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses if launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks the peace corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall within a year or two several thousand might be in service it can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated 	government
495	the need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest there would however be a variety of other skills medical agricultural engineering which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects the first years projects should also be spread through several countries in latin america africa and asia how will the peace corps be received abroad although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to receive it from the united states will vary from country to country 	government
496	unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility but there are indications that many developing nations will welcome peace corps volunteers and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends it is important however that the peace corps be advanced not as an arm of the cold war but as a contribution to the world community in presenting it to other governments and to the united nations we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the united nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee we should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands 	government
497	the peace corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership our aim must be to learn as much as we teach the peace corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the united states the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower if presented in this spirit the response and the results will be immeasurably better the already appropriated funds within the discretion of the president and secretary of state under the mutual security act are the only immediately available source of financing this summers pilot programs of the peace corps 	government
498	congress should then be asked to give the peace corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year specifically congress should consider authorizing the peace corps to receive contributions from american businesses unions civic organizations and the public at large for this must be the project of the whole american people an advisory council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding steps should also be taken to link the food for peace program with the peace corps so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of us surplus food under pl ### can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of peace corps personnel 	government
499	is it worth the cost and the risks no matter how well conceived and efficiently run there probably will be failures these could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad but as the popular response suggests the potentiality of the peace corps is very great it can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions 	government
500	it can also contribute to the education of america and to more intelligent american participation in the world with thousands of young americans going to work in developing areas millions of americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before with colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program and with students looking toward peace corps service there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness the letters home the talks later given by returning members of the peace corps the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible american policies toward the world and this is meeting the worlds need too since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world 	government
501	as you said in your state of the union message the problems are towering and unprecedented and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well i recommend to the congress the establishment of a permanent peace corps a pool of trained american men and women sent overseas by the us government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower i have today signed an executive order establishing a peace corps on a temporary pilot basis the temporary peace corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization in addition by starting the peace corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall 	government
502	its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires our own freedom and the future of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity liberated from the bonds of hunger ignorance and poverty one of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages the mountains the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations the vast task of economic development urgently requires skilled people to do the work of the society to help teach in the schools construct development projects demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge 	government
503	this organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice there is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them in #### onequarter of the ### million recreation visits to the national forests and grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing hunter and fisherman visits since #### have increased # times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses 	government
504	the longrange objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment the wildlife habitat management proposals for the ##year period are # revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources improve food and cover on ## million acres of key wildlife areas develop wildlife openings food patches and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on ###### acres 	government
505	the total adverse impact of disease insects fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized they kill and destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage values and disrupt uses the loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the united states in #### was estimated to be about ## billion board feet if it were not for the effect of destructive agencies sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the ## billion board feet in #### about ## percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease ## percent to insects ## percent to fire and ## percent to weather animals and various other causes 	government
506	the longrange objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and highlevel sustained yield of products and services this can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations in addition to direct protection measures more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease in the ##year period it is proposed that insect and disease control on the national forest system be stepped up to a level of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period this will require about a ## percent increase over the present level of protection 	government
507	 b more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage  c quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a largescale epidemic the initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to ###### acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production the objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed 	government
508	coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses it is proposed that in ## years all commercial timberlands all critical watersheds and other lands in the national forest system developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads this will include ### million acres compared with ## million acres now receiving such protection an additional ## million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for # 	government
509	this is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort detection skilled firefighting crews and equipment use this will include a steppedup program of training and development of personnel adoption and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention for suppression of fires while small and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to highvalue areas this work will cover the most serious onefourth of all land needing such treatment and will consist of burning ###### acres of highly hazardous debris concentration felling snags on ###### acres of high lightningoccurrence areas prescribed burning on ## million acres removing roadside fuel on ##### acres and clearing and maintaining ##### miles of firebreaks 	government
510	these areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the national forests approximately ## million acres of rangelands and ## million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known the transportation system which serves the national forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions this system is divided into a forest highway system administered by the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system administered by the secretary of agriculture 	government
511	in the forest highway system there are now ##### miles of public roads these are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the secretary of commerce with maintenance provided by the states and counties this development program for the national forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed it is estimated that about ##### miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the national forests in the forest development road and trail system there are now ###### miles of roads and ###### miles of supplemental foot and horse trails 	government
512	construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture it is estimated that about ###### miles of forest development roads and ##### miles of trails constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resources of the national forests on a continuing basis the ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds the presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as a 	government
513	the balanced use of recreation hunting and fishing areas the volume of timber that can be marketed especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire windstorm insects and disease the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals the existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes that is not otherwise possible 	government
514	use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve the longrange objective of this department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services for the year #### this means servicing a the protection requirements of a watershed producing at least ### million acrefeet of water each year b recreation and wildlife resources used each year by ### million visitors c a timber resource supporting an annual cut of ## billion board feet and d ## million acres of rangelands service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about ###### miles of new roads and #### miles of new trails along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about ###### miles of roads and ##### miles of trails about ##### miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads 	government
515	program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the ##year period ######## are as follows # complete the construction and reconstruction of about ##### miles of multiplepurpose roads and #### miles of trails this constitutes about ## percent of the longrange requirements for these facilities approximately ## percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of national forest timber but paid for by the government through adjustment of stumpage prices provide maintenance to full standards on the ###### miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period 	government
516	in some units national forest ownership is well blocked together in many others the previous patenting of land under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership within exterior boundaries of national forests and national grasslands there are about ######## acres in nonfederal ownership one consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring national forest or other federal land or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring national forest land some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these federal lands 	government
517	there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the eastern states the longrange objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized national forest programs such as recreation development or which are a source of damage to lands in national forests and national grasslands strategy and tactics of the us military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history the change of emphasis from conventionaltype to missiletype warfare must be made with care mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other 	government
518	 this budget will provide in the fiscal year #### for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level a yearend strength of ####### men and women in the active forces the forces to be supported include an army of ## divisions and ###### men a navy of ### active ships and ###### men a marine corps of # divisions and # air wings with ###### men and an air force of ## combat wings and ###### men 	government
519	quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers under modern conditions this is especially true of the ready reserve i have requested the secretary of defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare last year the congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the army reserve similar restrictions on the strength of the army national guard contained in the #### department of defense appropriation act should likewise be dropped 	government
520	i again proposed a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve from their present strengths of ###### and ###### respectively to ###### and ###### by the end of the fiscal year #### these strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives  about ##% of the expenditures for the department of defense in #### are for military personnel costs including pay for active reserve and retired military personnel these expenditures are estimated to be $### billion an increase of $### million over #### reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel more dependents an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay and social security tax increases effective for the full year in #### compared with only # months in #### retired pay costs are increased by $## million in #### over #### partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel 	government
521	traditionally rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel the #### military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a #% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of june # #### i endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates  expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the armed forces are estimated to be $### billion in #### which is $### million more than in #### the increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment 	government
522	also the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in #### causing an increase in expenditures further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the congress last year other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour up ##% in two years and of each steaming hour up ##% in total these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the armed forces in the budget message for #### and again for #### i recommended immediate repeal of section ### of the act of september ## #### ## stat ### 	government
523	as i have stated previously the attorney general has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles accordingly if it is not repealed by the congress at its present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise basic longline communications in alaska are now provided through federal facilities operated by the army air force and federal aviation agency the growing communications needs of this new state can best be met as they have in other states through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these governmentowned systems in alaska and its early enactment is desirable 	government
524	in #### these expenditures are estimated at $### billion compared to $### billion in #### the decreases which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles guns and electronic devices expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in #### new obligational authority for #### recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement excluding amounts for related research and construction totals $#### million which is $#### million below that enacted for #### on the other hand the new authority of $#### million proposed for missile procurement excluding research and construction in #### is $### million higher than for #### 	government
525	the department of defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items as i have repeatedly stated this provision is much more restrictive than the general law popularly known as the buy american act i urge once again that the congress not reenact this rider the task of providing a reasonable level of military strength without endangering other vital aspects of our security is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress the last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history 	government
526	furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological breakthrough on any one weapon system in itself often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems this has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events thus in the last few years a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated for example the importance of the regulus # a very promising aerodynamic shiptosurface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines another example is the recent cancellation of the f### a longrange interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid####s 	government
527	considering the high cost of the f### system over $# billion for the force that had been planned and the time period in which it would become operational it was decided to stop further work on the project meanwhile other air defense forces are being made effective as described later in this message the size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans notable in this category are the jupiter and thor intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed produced and deployed but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile the impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the highenergy fuel program 	government
528	continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means have now raised serious questions about the value of the highenergy fuel program as a result the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed these examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and farranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology the cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development in determining the most satisfactory rate of development and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it  the deterrent power of our armed forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war 	government
529	the second capability is represented by our deployed ground naval and air forces in essential forward areas together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement the strategic air command is the principal element of our longrange nuclear capability one of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the b## a longrange supersonic bomber this aircraft which was planned for initial operational use about #### would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems all of which are scheduled to become available earlier the first atlas icbms are now operational the first two polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year and the first titan icbms next year 	government

540	the present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast am band from ### kc to #### kc whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of the other the extent of such interference which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations depends on many factors among the principal ones being the distance between the stations their respective radiated power and of particular significance here the time of day other factors playing a part in the extent of am service and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along the transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others with the existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the commission to make assignments of am stations on a casetocase basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances 	government
541	an example of the overall standards applied is the ##to# ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable by this standard it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved objectionable interference from station a exists at any point within the service area of station b where station as signal is of an intensity onetwentieth or more of the strength of station bs signal at that point the ##to# ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in am assignments and allocations that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service a second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies this is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere 	government
542	but during the middle daytime hours these skywave radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are in general negligible but during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere thereby creating the possibility of one stations rendering service via skywave at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the am band with many more stations operating during the day than at night it was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions and vice versa is not an instantaneous process but takes place over periods of time from roughly # hours before sunset until about # hours after sunset and again from roughly # hours before sunrise until some # hours after sunrise during the period of about # hours around sunset skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail 	government
543	however in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations representing an averaging of conditions and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions it was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this purpose accordingly the ###### rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations class # stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset for daytime class # stations or sunset at the location of the dominant class # station where located west of the class # station for limitedtime class # stations the same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class # stations operating on regional channels which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other 	government
544	these curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data it was recognized that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength for this reason the more uncertain skywave service was denominated secondary in our rules as compared to the steadier more reliable groundwave primary service and for both skywave service and skywave interference signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signalintensity level is exceeded ## percent of the time for skywave service ## percent of the time for skywave interference as mentioned the allocation of am stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations the rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the nation 	government
545	to provide some service to all listeners to provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible to provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized and to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others accordingly the commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations 	government
546	in dealing with these frequencies the objective listed first above provision of service to all listeners was predominant the class # stations on these clear channels are protected to their ##mv/m groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference with respect to skywave service rendered at night class # a stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the united states on clear channels specified for class # a operation and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received class # b stations are protected at night to their ##mv/m ##percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference only class # stations are capable of rendering skywave service 	government
547	with respect to other frequencies these are designated as regional or local and assigned for use by class # and class # stations respectively stations operating generally with lower power in the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of longrange service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible as mentioned the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service free from destructive interference during nighttime hours because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it therefore under our longstanding allocation rules on some of these channels no station other than the dominant class # a station is permitted to operate at night so that the # a station can render service interference free wherever it can be received 	government
548	in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels additional class # assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class # stations or to each other and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities such additional daytime class # assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies and the commission has over the years made a large number of them similarly on the regional channels many class # stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power essentially the question presented for decision in the present daytime skywave proceeding is whether our decision in ######## to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset is sound as a basis for am allocations or whether in the light of later developments and new understanding skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours 	government
549	since then there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena in #### affidavits were filed with the commission by various clearchannel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours from class # stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference if you elect to use the standard deduction or the tax table and later find you should have itemized your deductions you may do so by filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim for refund see you may claim a refund page ### the same is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should have used the standard deduction or tax table 	government

573	these were educated men who as mr justice holmes was fond of saying formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility that is to put it realistically they had to run their businesses at a profit or they had to get the votes to get elected nevertheless they made naught of marxs prophecy that capitalism would never pay the workers to use marxs word more than a subsistence wage with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists pockets with the result in turn that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase but as all understand who have eyes to see nothing of the kind has happened the gulf between the rich and the poor has narrowed in the industrialized western world to the point that the word poor is hardly applicable 	government

575	the greater the range of choice the greater the rate of change for change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future but when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose men individual men must remain in status and society does not cannot progress the eternal truth is that progress due as it always is to individual creative genius is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart and lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report let me enlighten them with the truths that under communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the foundation and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the fellows might proceed untrammeled in every way toward their discoveries their creative efforts for the good of mankind 	government

580	the basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in #### by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine that development in turn formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years in gear cutting in circular graduating in index drilling and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement throughout their careers both mr brown and mr sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades several efforts were made in this direction and though not all of them survive to this day the brown & sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the american standard and is still in common use today as one development followed another the companys reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture 	government
581	as the story goes mr gibbs who originally came from the back counties of the commonwealth of virginia saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous howe sewing machine curious as to what made it work he built a crude model of it in wood and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread enabling the crude machine to take stitches when he showed this model as his solution as to how the howe sewing machine operated he was told he was wrong and discovered to his amazement that the howe machine which was unknown to him in detail used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one thus was invented the single thread sewing machine which mr gibbs in partnership with mr willcox decided to bring to brown & sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture the new work was a boon to the partnership not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of j r brown toward yet further developments for production equipment 	government
582	mr brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock and reversible tap and die holders in #### mr browns attention was called to yet another basic production problem the manufacture of twist drills at that time during the civil war union muskets were being manufactured in providence and the drills to drill them were being handfiled with rattail files this process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor mr browns imagination of the possibilities in the situation the child of this problem was mr browns famous serial no # universal milling machine the archtype from which is descended todays universal kneetype milling machine used throughout the world 	government
583	during the civil war period mr brown also invented the brown & sharpe formed tooth gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the worlds gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth but they were good for only one sharpening as soon as the time came for resharpening the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made this process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated resharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form mr browns invention achieved this and as a byproduct formed the cornerstone of brown & sharpes position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the ####s when superceded by other methods 	government
584	although mr brown was not himself its inventor it was a french idea it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use so it was that when mr brown and mr sharpe first saw the french tool on exhibition in paris in #### they brought a sample with them to the united states and started brown & sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day the final achievement of mr browns long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine that achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine which made its appearance in #### at the philadelphia centennial exposition this machine like its milling counterpart was the antecedent of a machinefamily used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world 	government
585	following mr browns death there came forward in the brown & sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company as head of the firm darling & swartz mr darling began by challenging brown & sharpe to its keenest competition during the ####s and early ##s in #### however a truce was called between the companies and the partnership of darling brown & sharpe was formed between that year and the buying out of mr darlings interest in #### a large portion of the companys precision tool business was carried out under the name of darling brown & sharpe and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of mr browns tradition for accuracy was mr oscar j beale whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of mr brown and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled brown & sharpe to manufacture gages and therefore its products with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world 	government
586	mr viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men he was an ardent champion of the brown & sharpe apprentice program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company in one sense it can be said that one of the most important brown & sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad commencing with the death of lucian sharpe in #### the name of henry d sharpe was for more than ## years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company during his presidency the companys physical plant was enormously expanded and the length and breadth of the brown & sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world 	government
587	during these years the companys product line followed the basic tenets laid down by mr brown it expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines from simple formedtooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business from rudimentary beltdriven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled kneetype and manufacturing type milling machines in the grinding machine field expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders surface grinders and a wide variety of special and semispecial models in #### henry d sharpe jr succeeded his father and continued the companys development as a major factor in the metalworking equipment business the company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts 	government
588	recently added is the brown & sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development in the industrial products division the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment machinists tools including micrometers vernier calipers and accessories in the cutting tool division the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters end mills and saws sales and net income for the year ended december ## #### showed an improvement over #### net income was $####### or $### per share on ###### common shares currently outstanding as compared to $####### or $### per share in #### adjusted to the same number of shares 	government
589	this increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development in spite of the fact that our largest market the textile industry was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year #### at a rate materially higher than during #### our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed our production for #### will be lower than for #### however the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of #### in connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sounder u s income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis could if adopted have favorable effects on leesonas business in the next few years 	government
590	our research and development program serving as it does an industry which must compete against lowcost production throughout the world continues to have primary emphasis at leesona this program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values fabrics whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment in terms of efficiency and versatility but more important we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the unifil loom winder and our more recent uniconer automatic coning machine on this basis our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to leesonas future growth in sales and earnings 	government
591	in december we began to ship our ultrahighspeed stretch yarn machines these machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics during the past year great progress has been made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved wash and wear dresses and blouses made from these fabrics this machine operating at speeds up to ###### revolutions per minute is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today 	government
592	our new largepackage ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers mills later in the year additional types of this leesona twister will be made available to mills for other manmade fibers and natural yarns these machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds larger yarn packages and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn this we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment major activity at providence in #### will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the uniconer automatic coning machine 	government
593	this machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry the potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the unifil loom winder the uniconer has several outstanding features it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment it incorporates an automatic knottying device on each spindle and it will knot a break in the yarn in ## seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted because the bobbintocone winding process is a relatively highcost operation for the mill the almost complete automation provided by the uniconer can mean important economies in textile production at the same time upgrading quality 	government
594	a new application for the unifil loom winder running single filling for box looms will broaden mill use of this equipment a new spinning takeup machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our takeup machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns it is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed this new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to #### feet per minute it is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time 	government
595	we look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field we are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods or components for industrial products and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction our patterson moos research division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells the cooperation of our exclusive american licensee pratt & whitney aircraft division of united aircraft corporation has been important in this work in addition to its major effort on fuel cells patterson moos research division is continuing to carry on research in other fields both under contract for the defense department other government agencies and for our own account 	government
596	we have recently entered into an agreement with compagnie generale de telegraphie sans fil csf of france for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials the agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the united states initially we will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from france but later we will manufacture in this country there is a rapidly growing demand for this material primarily from the military further research we believe will develop important commercial applications 	government
597	we are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity the rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation our plan is to keep abreast of these advances and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities early in august we broke ground for a new $####### plant in warwick rhode island which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations construction is well along and the plant is scheduled for completion in november of this year 	government
598	operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in #### an architects sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover the building will contain ###### square feet approximately the same as our present plant however its modern onestory layout is designed to increase our production capacity permit more efficient manufacturing and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs a major consideration in the choice of the warwick site four miles from cranston was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force 	government
599	during the year our british subsidiary leesonaholt limited expanded its plant in darwen england and added machine tool capacity the operations of its other plant in rochdale and leesonas former operations in manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of heywood layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis the area available at heywood is approximately three times the size of the former rochdale and manchester locations in addition land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future 	government
600	it will be transfered on completion to the industrial foundation of rhode island a nonprofit organization which will reimburse us for the cost of construction we will then occupy the new plant under lease with an option to purchase these arrangements are in our opinion very favorable to leesona interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from the chase manhattan bank in addition to expenditures on the warwick plant we have invested approximately $####### for machinery and equipment at cranston and for new machinery plant and equipment at leesonaholt limited 	government
601	long term loans have been reduced by $###### to $####### inventories increased $###### to $####### during the year and should decline in coming months thus we enter #### in a strong financial position in accordance with the twoyear contract signed in may #### with the international association of machinists aflcio wages of hourly employees were increased by #% in may #### and pay levels for nonexempt salaried employees were increased proportionately in addition blue cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semiprivate hospital accommodations 	government
602	during the pension year ended december ## #### ## employees retired making a total of ### currently retired under the companys pension plan at december ## #### the fund held by the industrial national bank of providence as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan totaled $####### the basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began ## years ago another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living as in many other industries rising costs and intense competition both domestic and foreign have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years 	government
603	as a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility the problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration production must be adjusted accordingly at minimum cost and quickly in addition production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics as well as blends following the term of service in japan each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community 	government
604	the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining under skilled direction the choir the orchestra the band the glee club and smaller ensembles of wind and string players all students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify orchestra band and choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes the glee club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership 	government

619	weekend activities for the entire campus are planned by the coop board in recent months much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future and yet despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade #### has been a good year in many ways with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole the shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle this caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level 	government
620	factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years while those at retail are below #### the total value of our industrys shipments at factory prices increased from $## billion in #### to approximately $### billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business home entertainment military industrial and replacement i believe a further gain is in prospect for #### reflecting the largest percentage of highend sets such as consoles and combinations since #### dollar value of home entertainment electronics in #### was about $## billion compared to $## billion in #### sales of tv sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of #### through july 	government
621	for the year as a whole retail sales of tv sets probably came to ## million against ## million in #### however production came to only ## million compared to ## million in contrast to the lower turnout of tv total radio production increased from ### million sets to ### million excluding export both home and auto radios were in excellent demand with retail sales of home sets ahead of #### in every month of the first eleven sales and production of home sets were about equal at ### million units 	government
622	separate phonographs also had a good year reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radiotv market the outlook for entertainment electronics in #### is certainly far from clear at present but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods i would expect that sales at retail in the first half of #### might be below #### by some ## ##% but that secondhalf levels should show a favorable comparison with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will i look for tv sales and production to be approximately equal at ## million sets for the year but i look for some decline in radios from the high rate in #### to more nearly the #### level of ### ### million sets i therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $## million slightly below #### but above #### 	government
623	it is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industrys total sales to all markets in ######## which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance it has been correctly pointed out by wellinformed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of ##% or better that characterized the decade of the ####s and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability while this may well be true in general i believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the polaris and b## programs strengthening of the airborne alert system of the strategic air command and improved battlefield surveillance systems research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite samos and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as nikezeus are expected to increase substantially 	government
624	still later the realm of space technology will show substantial gains it has been estimated that spending by the national aeronautics and space administration will rise from less than $### million in fiscal #### to more than $# billion by #### and that the electronic industrys share of these expenditures will be closer to ##% than the current ##% the steppedup defense procurement called for in the #### budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it and it has been suggested that an additional $# billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal #### although the impact of these increases on our industrys shipments will be gradual on balance i look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year to at least $# billion paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $## billion compared to $## billion in #### 	government
625	informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late ####s under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing industrial process control and information storage and retrieval in the industrial field prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright for the near term however it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market and for this reason i would expect that any gain in #### may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years sales should slightly exceed #### however and reach $## billion in addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year 	government
626	the markets for electronic parts in #### have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates in the military field incoming orders turned down early in the year and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components sales of transistors in #### exceeded $### million compared to $### million in #### despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types production totalled about ### million units against ## million in #### and i look for a further gain to ### million units worth approximately $### million in #### 	government
627	in sum i look for another good year for the electronics industry in #### with total sales increasing about #% to $### billion despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally as i have indicated above i base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the fullyear figures close to those of #### on prospects for continued increases in defense spending and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the ####s the appointment of gilbert b devey as general manager of vectrol engineering inc of stamford connecticut a leading manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical controls has been announced by david b peck vice president special products 	government
628	mr brown will at the same time undertake expansion of vectrols custom design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff mr deveys new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of spragues special products group which manufactures a wide line of digital electronic components packaged component assemblies and high temperature magnet wires mr devey first came to sprague in #### as a product specialist in the field engineering department coming from the office of naval research in washington d c where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare studies during world war # he was a lieutenant commander in the united states navy mr devey is a graduate of the massachusetts institute of technology and attended the united states naval academy postgraduate school specializing in electronic engineering 	government

630	he is a fellow of the american institute of electrical engineers and a senior member of the institute of radio engineers he is a member of the institution of electrical engineers london a registered professional engineer in connecticut and ohio and a chartered electrical engineer in great britain the promotion of robert e swift to the position of assistant manager of the interference control field service department was announced early in december by frederick s scarborough manager of interference control field service the appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electromagnetic compatability problems between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters 	government
631	since faculty see themselves as selfemployed professionals rather than as employees enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course the faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship the president expects faculty members to remember in exercising their autonomy that they share no collective responsibility for the universitys income nor are they personally accountable for toplevel decisions he may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy but he has a right to expect in return that they will leave administrative matters to the administration how well do faculty members govern themselves 	government
632	they sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government they too need to learn to delegate letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention although faculties insist on governing themselves they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government there are nevertheless several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege 	government
633	he can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the actionoriented faculty by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration complaints of a lack of communication persist the cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose 	government
634	the need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation to increase faculty influence and decrease tension many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly the president has little influence in daybyday curricular changes but if he looks ahead two three or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas he can open the way for innovation and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take success will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogatives patience and persistence the critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands 	government
635	they serve not only as spokesmen for their areas but they also contribute to toplevel decision making the president who appoints strong men who have an allcollege or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance faculty members depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration the administration at the same time looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments one way that this can be done other than by hiring new highpriced professors is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance 	government
636	by supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards the president can encourage faculty leadership indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to the academic dean should take a direct longterm interest in faculty development an alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs plans for the future qualifications of those on the job and bright prospects elsewhere for the maintenance of a longterm program the departments and particularly their chairmen are strategic 	government
637	to provide an independent judgment for the president the academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly at some colleges and universities a faculty committee reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates some faculty members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat departments actions or act pro forma they can be effective however if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work at one university the president cites the faculty review committee as a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty 	government
638	the president or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind no good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria to avoid passing over quiet unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by their departments there are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the mans former achievements 	government
639	in particular the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale on those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action a true university like most successful marriages is a unity of diversities without forcing all components into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest level which a university in contrast to a multiversity should stand for recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institutionwide goals each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core for all undergraduates 	government
640	in the first instance adequate appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be planned in the second more shops laboratories and staff will be required for the president a master plan looking ahead five years the maximum reach for sound forecasting offers several practical advantages trustees faculty and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made instead of afterwards physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed 	government
641	more than one president has found that a longrange plan helps him to attract major gifts it inspires confidence in his institutions determination to establish goals and to achieve them before deciding where it is going however a college or university must know where it is the first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty by outside consultants or by a combination of the two it should sternly appraise curricula faculty organization buildings faculty work loads and potential for growth in stature and size 	government
642	some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically funds may be readily donated for some purposes but not others a plan must therefore be brought up to date periodically possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer to provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research some offices have very broad responsibilities touching on almost all aspects of a universitys instructional program 	government
643	more often these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data the presidents opportunity for influencing education reaches its highest point as he decides which projects he will cut back which he will advance by increased allowances or new fundraising efforts no matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents when the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the presidents budget to which his faith and credit are committed its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment 	government
644	he reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money an institution should choose its fields of prominence otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy at worst and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branches of learning in the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the joneses in all branches 	government
645	here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role in the areas that do not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinates will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention the president should find strong subordinates and delegate the widest discretion to them higher education cannot compete with the salary scales of the business world but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income just as the entire faculty should know the presidents educational philosophy and objectives so should nonacademic officers 	government
646	they neither liked nor disliked the old man to them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after mass and at noon and at six each evening its tone repetitive monotonous never breaking the boredom of the streets yet if he were not there they would have missed him as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early june or the smell of thick tomato paste the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in flydotted cheesecloth or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights 	romance
647	they never called him by name although he had one filippo rossi thats what he was called in the old country but here he was just signore or the old man but this was not unusual because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders it went to church on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession 	romance

650	calloused fingers caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted never to be tweezed away mauvecolored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of mans tongue had not smiled but had condemned again and again but if the old man even thought about his wife now nobody cared a fig it was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance as thin as the seams on her stockings and still thinner his voice had not commanded her to stop 	romance
651	but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him  and his eyes those miniature sundials of variegated yellow had not altered their expression or direction the old mans very soul could have left him and flown down that street but he wouldnt have had anyone know it perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife but when he called for his withered wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar 	romance

657	he would not be like the rich americans who lived in whitecolumned houses on the other side of the park he would not ride the eightthirty local to the city each morning he would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running bowing with her running calling out in her bowing at your service he would order her to bring coffee and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff he would not remove his gloves and light and smoke 	romance
658	he called to his sister on the porch above the steps she was only ten months older than he  laura what would you say if i smoked a pipe she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence brushing and drying her wet gilded hair in the sun one lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking torn pales 	romance
659	all the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her chest her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii it was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours the eyes blue and always somewhat downcast possessed a sullen quality even though the boy could not see them he knew they were clouded by distance 	romance
660	pompeii called again laura but the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it  shes in a mood he thought theres not a month she doesnt get herself in a mood well what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about and as for his pipe if he wanted to smoke one nobody would stop him 	romance

663	there would be time enough perhaps the old man reassured himself to pay the devil his due in the meantime six sandals stained an ocher the same color as pompeiis shaved hair edged up close to him the clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to niobe the neatest ones to concetta and the laced ones to romeo concettas idiot brother pompeii expected romeos small body to sink closer and closer to the ground 	romance

711	henrietta looked down at her bouquet still lively with its color and scent and set her feet on their journeys way again leaving the village street and crossing the first field folly dancing ahead of her at the edge of the field the wild rolling land took over dotted with fat round bushes like sheep they were covered with tiny white blossoms their scant roots clawing at the stony ground and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry the air was full of sounds too but placid ones a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky she felt mindless walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to doaty 	romance

713	they had white skins and blue eyes all their men were bearded and many of their women were beautiful a pitiful few of them are left now to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the american indians most of them have been assimilated but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honeyinthesun tint of the invaders from the south tommy momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions 	romance
714	her nose was higher of bridge her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong her mouth soft and full was something for any man to dream about she had black eyes long and intriguingly tilted and the way she walked was melody she had been in japan just one week it was an alien land and she hated it intensely 	romance
715	anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward there were no depressingly serious cases the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor sometimes the navy sent people back to the states to preserve a marriage but mental health as a rule was very high at present the doctors main concern was in seeing to it that japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore because the work involved setting off nerveshattering blasts at all hours tommy was interested in psychiatry because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients 	romance
716	she had changed into a cocktail dress and the whole evening should have been before her but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck this was one of the navys crossroads you find them all around the world ships from the west coast rotated on sixmonth tours of duty with the seventh fleet and yokosuka was the seventh fleets principal port for maintenance upkeep and shore liberty sooner or later all the gray navy ships came in here if tommy sat long enough she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long beach 	romance
717	she felt rather than saw the approach of the goodlooking young man he came through from the fleet bar which was stag with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried when he saw tommy sitting alone the tinkling sound stopped he was perhaps a trifle tipsy having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted and consequently out of practice he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in hong kong and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant 	romance
718	there was a fiftyfifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different japan did something to a man and it wasnt just japan either because the same thing applied anywhere overseas it was as if foreign duty implied and excused license it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it and therefore why not then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different 	romance
719	maybe you likee date with me  i dont believe i know you and i cant understand your quaint brand of english it was meant to be english wasnt it the nicelooking young officer fell back on his heels openmouthed and blushing at least he had the decency to blush she thought you see i thought i mean i really had no idea 	romance
720	then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture and dropped into navy slang he muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy it hadnt been this way in college or in nurses training it wasnt this way in the hospital at san diego 	romance
721	nobody had addressed her in broken english at any of those places nobody had suggested that she wasnt american there are spanish girls who look like tommy momoyama brunettes with a moorish hint of the orient in their faces there are beauties from the balkan states who are similarly endowed and back in the blessed united states they were regarded simply as pretty women now having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for tommy was being humiliated at every turn four little japanese waitresses were murdering the english language at the counter yuki kobayashi happened to be one of them 	romance

723	but she was learning that so long as she was in this country and wore civilian dress in the club there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken english there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese after coming to america her parents had spoken only english she had been sent to the wrong place for duty there was more to service in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward 	romance
724	now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar it was terribly off key and poorly done and tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing but all at once she felt lonesome and putupon she finished her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion 	romance
725	then after a while she went to her mirror she certainly looked japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young men and still they did not have to be so crude in their approach there was a letter to write to her mother and she tried to make its tone cheerful she promised that she would soon take a few days leave and visit the uncle she had never seen on the island of oyajima which was not very far from yokosuka 	romance
726	tommy of course had never heard of a kotowaza or japanese proverb which says tanin yori miuchi and is literally translated as relatives are better than strangers actually this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water doc doolittles scheduled appearance at captains mast was a very unusual thing because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report but the beer hall riot in subic had been unusual too and walt perry was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didnt know 	romance
727	the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief there had never been a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up he had come into the navy too young with the image of the funloving guns appleby before him the war found him much too early and its perils and especially its awful boredom were best forgotten in horseplay and elaborate practical jokes and even now doc had never found any stabilizing sobering influence he remained young at heart with an overdeveloped sense of humor 	romance

729	at yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of the base because walt perry being thoughtful knew that doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply base this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment and suited him quite well there were two things he wanted to do inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the naval base and visit an old shipmate a telephone line had been hooked up to connect the ship with the base exchange after supper doc called whitey gresham who was now a lieutenant and had a family 	romance

752	alexander said answer me properly spencer spencer was quiet for a moment longer then he said there is nothing i want to say captain naval procedure he thought had its moments of grim humor philip spencer had coldbloodedly planned the murder of his captain yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address during the morning hours it became clear that the arrest of spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the somers 	romance
753	hostile glances were flashed at both alexander and gansevoort  what is the next step captain in your opinion who is this e andrews on the certain list he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot he saw the dangers not the glories of being identified as a mutineer 	romance
754	there was a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished to see the captain heiser breathless and wildeyed brought the chilling news that the handspikes heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places  and also sir two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely an african knife and battleax are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley and green mckinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into spencers possession and that 	romance
755	who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind him a glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away the aimless milling about of what had been a welltrained wellorganized crew struck alexander with horror he bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched too the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction 	romance
756	i saw him myself and it was done after consultation with cromwell and it was clear that adrien was not mistaken for both small and cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till philip spencer had given the signal to obey then with disappointment evident upon their faces they moved to the work alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed their strategy was sound enough and he reasoned had been defeated only by philip spencers unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated 	romance
757	spencers potential followers were openly sullen and morose missing muster without excuse expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons communicating with the three by glance and signal one of the missing handspikes came out of its hiding place after midshipman tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by seaman wilson tillotson had reported the man to gansevoort and an hour later with back turned had been attacked by wilson brandishing the weapon wilson shackled and snarling was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by green mckee and mckinley not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny 	romance
758	three days had passed since spencers arrest and each day had brought new dangers new fears gansevoort said it requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely to have the greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed from actions aboard it is easy to guess that spencers boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate  well heiser ventured why dont we hold an investigation with questioning and 	romance
759	 there is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners besides suppose we hold a court of inquiry then what then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the united states they will be punished but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order mr heiser does this sound like a truly workable plan to you do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now 	romance
760	they are about to do so at any moment as it is all that is needed is for one man to feel selfconfident enough to take the lead as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from spencer we are going to be rushed we are going to be rushed and murdered  that is extravagant language mr wales 	romance
761	 we are going to bring the somers into new york harbor safe and sound  of course i agree with the captain gansevoort said thoughtfully but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand he paused then added everything on a ship is a weapon implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands 	romance
762	 under arms day and night watch and watch about those of us present the perry brothers deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the somers a great deal of labor we have as well for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed and when he was alone again in the cabin alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept for he knew full well what must be done what in the end would be done with all his heart he had loved the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navys implacable laws 	romance
763	he who had tried so hard who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer it came to him as he wept there aboard the somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven it was given or it was not given one did ones best and if fortune smiled there was a reward one did ones best and if fortune frowned an eighteenyearold boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard ones ship 	romance
764	god knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired for it had not been with an egotists rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist it was for love that he had served the navy to have someday that love returned was what he had lived for yes he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price 	romance
765	sternfaced he inspected the prisoners satisfying himself that they were clean well fed and comfortable within reason the prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger only cromwell the giant boatswain was mildmannered and respectful he said captain may i speak please captain i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship 	romance
766	 you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt  i cannot speak for others sir but i am innocent he leaned closer to alexander squinting up at him from the deck  surely captain you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything  no cromwell i did not find your name 	romance
767	he said cromwell is telling you the truth the calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend cromwell alexander knew spencer too well to think him naive or thickskulled and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognized a kinship with spencer here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable 	romance
768	he expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune the redhaired captain towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer this tragic lad had forged his own shackles but he could not have done so could not have found the way had fortune favored him and because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the redhaired captain they would be each others undoing 	romance
769	 i tell you he is innocent  and do you think there is a reason why i should accept your word i have nothing to gain by defending cromwell  nothing to lose either spencer  thats true spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation 	romance
770	 i am innocent captain cromwell said again  before god captain i am innocent and though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth still it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell no action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen prior to their knowing the significance of the greek paper had seen it in cromwells hands while spencer whispered explanations  i thought midshipman rogers had told alexander that spencer was teaching him geometry 	romance
771	this was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized some of these apprentices were in physical strength already men and doubtless a percentage of them were spencers followers rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the torah a young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides he wore a long doublebreasted coat of a heavy material dark trousers and black boots with buckles 	romance

773	rachel had seen me watching the young man  when your mother was here he must have been a young boy like the ones you will see now i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside rachel she led me into a twisting side alley 	romance

778	the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake i could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair his body pitched back and forth on the bench i shuddered and backed out of the room rachel followed looked at me and clucked with her tongue 	romance

1004	we finished the bottle i hadnt had a lot out of it earlier not speaking much to each other and we stayed sober i suppose we were cold but we didnt feel it we seemed to be drowsing sadly soberly in the cold cold air while the snow fell then she said allons and we got up and went to my hotel without another word we undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance i had once known with valery 	romance

1008	 you are very tactful do you know stephen she remarked  yes because you didnt run off to use that new toothbrush i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror  i didnt really use yours she went on i know men never kiss les putains 	romance
1009	she smiled all the way to her wise sad eyes and drained her own i asked touching the scar on her stomach it was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle the cynicism was back in her eyes a bitter wisdom and i wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all she understood sex anyway and played at it well 	romance
1010	it was a nice place not filled with smoke the sommelier brought the wine first a magnum instead of the bottle i had ordered he must have thought i was a tourist i fixed him with a steely eye and said whats this for i didnt ask for a jeroboam of champagne 	romance
1011	two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield she put them in her bag she would not stop to read them in american express as many were doing sitting on benches or leaning against the walls but pushed her way out into the street this was her first day in rome and it was june an enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead in her minds eye her imagination responding fully almost exhaustingly to these shores peculiar powers of stimulation she saw the city as from above telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked aqueducts and tombs here a cypress there a pine and all around the low blue hills 	romance
1012	she would see them looking just as they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight moreover nursing various stubblefields her aunt then her mother then her father through their lengthy illnesses everybody could tell you the stubblefields were always sick theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot england france germany switzerland and italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight to see all these places with her own eyes the very night after her fathers funeral she had thought though never admitted to a soul now i can go so here it was here was italy anyway and terribly noisy 	romance
1013	cars taxis buses and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain shoals of tourists went by her in national groups english school girls in blue uniforms german boys with cameras attached smartly dressed americans looking in shop windows glad to be alone theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left something special was going on here just now the annual display of azalea plants she had heard about it the night before at her hotel 	romance
1014	the azaleas were as large as shrubs and their myriad blooms many still tight in the bud ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink along with many white ones too marvelous thought theresa climbing in her portly wellbred way for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything in rome all over europe she intended to move very slowly indeed halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down other people were doing it too sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above watching the azaleas mass or just enjoying the sun 	romance
1015	the sun warmed her as it seemed to be warming everything perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette how could you be both at once presently she picked up the first of the letters a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay 	romance
1016	poor cousin elec she thought tears rising to sting in the sun but why couldnt he have arranged to live through the summer and how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her her cousin emma carraway had written it in her loose high old ladys script ts carefully crossed but ls inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope cousin emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield rome italy on the envelope had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka alabama and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her nextdoor neighbor 	romance
1017	 across the envelope and now theresa had it all as easily as if she had been the president of the republic or the pope inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness death and burial of cousin alexander carraway cousin emma and cousin elec brother and sister unmarried devoted aging had lived next door to the stubblefields in tuxapoka from time immemorial until the stubblefields had moved to montgomery fifteen years ago two days before he was taken sick cousin elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas and cousin elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a motherofpearl paper knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died im supposed to care as much now as then as much here as there she realized with a sigh 	romance
1018	she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope and turned with relief to one from her brother george but alas george when he had written had only just returned from going to tuxapoka to cousin elecs funeral all the fine old stock was dying out look at the world today his own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for his grandchildren he had one so far still in diapers he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived had to be known at first hand 	romance
1019	theresa had seen him through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife anne had not seemed to understand poor george could it just be theresa wondered that anne had understood only too well and that george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull as for cousin alexander carraway the only thing theresa could remember at the moment about him except his paper knife was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one oclock in the morning the whole stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at cousin emmas call first papa then mother then theresa and george there they all did their uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot he had hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped in his bathrobe on a footstool 	romance
1020	they all surrounded him the family circle theresa and george as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens and cousin emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan  can you think of anything to do  i hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up ill just have to can you think of anything to do  you might treat it like the hiccups said papa 	romance
1021	 i just hope this happens to you someday said cousin elec who was not at his best  poor cousin elec george said he was younger than theresa she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused now here they both were still the same george full of roundeyed woe and cousin emma in despair  of course georges letter continued there are practical problems to be considered 	romance
1022	robbie and beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them and anne and i have told her shes more than welcome here but i think she feels that she might be an imposition especially as long as our rosie is still in high school the other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that tuxapoka is populated with miss edna whittaker for example but there is more in this than meets the eye a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off 	romance
1023	 i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best i really shouldnt have smoked a cigarette so early in the day thought theresa it always makes me sick ill start sneezing in a minute sitting on these cold steps she got up standing uncertainly for a moment then moving aside to let go past her talking a group of young men 	romance
1024	yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome and felt themselves to be so just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos parker fountain pens rosaries papal portraits he knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them carrozza rides in the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialized theresa turned away to escape and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two 	romance
1025	the lady with the alligator bag registered interest doubt then indignation she cast about as though looking for a policeman this really shouldnt be allowed finally she scurried away up the steps theresa stubblefield still holding the family letters in one hand realized that her whole trip to europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between cousin elecs death and doing something about cousin emma they were even anne and george probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out one or two countries and come home in august to get cousin emmas house ready before the teachers came to tuxapoka in september 	romance
1026	the trouble is theresa thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow it never registered with them that i had time to read all of balzac dickens and stendhal while papa was dying not to mention everything in the city library after mothers operation it would have been exactly the same to them if i had read through all twentysix volumes of elsie dinsmore she arranged the letters carefully one on top of the other 	romance
1027	she became aware that two italian workmen carrying a large azalea pot were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display  mi diapiace signora ma insomma she indicated a spot a little distance away i knew it as surely as everybody in westfield that lucille was a husband stealer you cant keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only ####plus 	romance
1028	just as it has its susan dolan though nobodyd ever bothered to tell me that they even talked about lucille down at the young christians league where i spent a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission i never heard my folks talk about her though they were goodliving religious people and i can truthfully say i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody even if they ever did say anything about people like lucille warren i know they wouldnt have dreamed of saying it in front of me 	romance
1029	and so i was really upset the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing mrs warren i asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck he gave me a straight honest answer  look sue baby hed said much as i love you well a guys a guy and lucilles willing to to come across 	romance
1030	i guess it was at that moment that i realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren my love for johnnie was young and clean how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who didnt hesitate to use her sex johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line it was a vivid sharp february morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing some stuff dad had ordered i wasnt in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men but the moment i saw johnnie i knew he was different 	romance
1031	he had an easy masculine grace about him the kind that kids dont have but that i had sometimes admired in other older men his smile was quick and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me too i could hardly believe such good luck was mine and now lucille warren had gotten a look at him 	romance
1032	a man had to have his release at least thats what the boys used to say in high school and i wasnt providing it for johnnie she wouldnt have even if hed asked her but he wouldnt ask her he wasnt the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will and he wouldnt leave her either hed told me that he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy 	romance

1094	 well its at fudomae and there was a tan young man quite naked taking a shower in the pool richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation but charlottes manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it three of the four persons present all foreign students in tokyo had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy was used as the modifier soba udon and tea were in because they could be taken noisily sashimi was in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to stay out even if it was a little pretentious 	romance

1098	he found himself trying to remember something but he couldnt decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall he had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at ryusenji he was unable to put it together that night after leaving charlottes apartment richard walked about for a time before returning to his room when he at last did go to his room he couldnt sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of acala thinking first of charlottes tale of the man at ryusenji then of his biwa and the invisible pacific waters 	romance

1101	he walked all the miles back to his room he seemed to have picked up a virus that day because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot he stayed home reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at ryusenji but the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldnt rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day the cold lingered making sleep difficult that night and he remained in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal the wretched sound the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life 	romance
1102	i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings it had grown hot early that day and i hoped that the boy my brothers son would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground carrying the jar of cool water the boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water and he always dragged an old snowfence lath or a stick along to play with he pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing tractor sounds with his lips i almost ran over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time 	romance
1103	it lay half in the furrow and half out and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when i put in the clutch the tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth and the tractor stopped instantly the snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made into the furrow and did not go any further i had never liked snakes much i still had that kind of quick panic that id had as a child whenever i saw one but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful he was multicolored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly 	romance
1104	i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out hoping to frighten him with the noise but the snake only flicked its black forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern i let the engine idle then and i got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it my movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again and its tongue was working very rapidly i followed it looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back the colors clear and sharp and perfect in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a babys fist down its back and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jetblack the colors were astonishing clear and bright and it was as if the body held a fire of its own and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin vivid and alive and warm 	romance
1105	his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth you beauty i said i couldnt kill you i had killed snakes before when i was younger but there had been no animal like this one and i knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die i picked him up and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant firecolored body like splendid ice and i knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him like fieldmice swallowed whole might make the body caressed through my hands like cool satin and my hands usually tanned and dark were pale beside it and i asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body 	romance
1106	the snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods the sharp burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target i felt good and satisfied looking at the snake it shone in its bright diamond color against the sunburned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself the color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien too in that dry and dusty and uncolored field 	romance
1107	i had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house the earth was a little heavy and i had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake the boy was there at the lower corner of the field and he was in the plowed earth stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience even at that distance with no sound but the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy i could see the hunchedup shoulders the savage determination the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick 	romance
1108	i stopped the tractor and i shouted down to the boy and i knew he could hear me for the morning was clear and still but he did not even hesitate in that brutal murdering dance i felt myself tremble thinking of the diamond light of that beauty i had held a few moments before and i wanted to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch the boy in the moment of his savagery and save a glimmer a remnant of that which i remembered but i knew it was already too late i drove the tractor on not looking down there i was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on my head began to ache and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes and i hated the job suddenly and i thought there are only moments when one sees beautiful things and these are soon crushed or they vanish 	romance
1109	he was eleven and we had done many things together he was a beautiful boy really with finelyspun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike and his eyes were blue he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up as he would smile on any other day he was my nephew my brothers son handsome and warm and newlyscrubbed with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brothers and mine as well i saw then too the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil through something there where i had been not long before 	romance
1110	 can i ride around with you he asked as he often did and i had as often let him be on the tractor beside me i looked closely at his eyes and he was already innocent the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his  no you cannot i said pushing aside the water jar he offered to me 	romance
1111	 yes he said eagerly beginning a kind of dance of excitement he tried to take my hand to show me  why did you kill it didnt you see how beautiful it was  snakes are ugly he said again 	romance

1139	and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life lying awake at night he could see them laid out on the floor of his mind when he rose in the morning the image was still there he had always been a messy and negligent man 	romance
1140	no doubt dolores resented following in their footsteps but it was fun those first days kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug there was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things he remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room at a party 	romance
1141	her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as black but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness so he sought her out and spoke to her and thought of his hand in her hair or against her back pressed on the column of vertebrae which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises like the snapped stem of a tulip but to put it bluntly nothing snapped yet that had not seriously troubled him not then 	romance
1142	he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly there was too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting they had left themselves too much to discover but at the start his new life felt invigorating it was on the tenth day after the wedding how could it have been so soon 	romance
1143	 now im not going to pick up those shorts  i think youll get tired of them there in the morning the shorts were where he had left them he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till dolores did for he had just remembered tonight they were having their first guests 	romance
1144	the rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts they gave the room a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute thinking he would get nervous i can be as stubborn as she can he thought shell rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings 	romance
1145	he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet away he could not cross the living room brush past her and bend down to retrieve the shorts bills hat was deposited in the hall closet with the most casual and relaxed manner in the world dolores led anthea to the bedroom then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there 	romance
1146	all evening anthea favored him with odd coy looks clearly she had been instructed not to say a word for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic at last there was a void no one could fill martin realized later on that he should have had it out with dolores that night 	romance
1147	on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fumed while she stayed calm and adamant and if he surrendered after raving at her suppose he ran up the white flag altogether in his head was the echo of those titters with anthea there was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean 	romance
1148	he could even recall the last time he sat there she was talking about him that time because he had done some bad thing something she disliked but afterwards martin said he was sorry he apologized so sweetly i couldnt keep being annoyed with him it wasnt even true that hed said he was sorry that time he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadnt happened which was as honest as he could put it 	romance
1149	if the situation had been bad it now got worse about this time people began dropping in considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough angrily martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip preferably one that lasted months instead of deciding not to postpone the date until he could get away here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores showing them around the apartment 	romance
1150	it was curious how the different visitors took this some tried to ignore the blot on the bedrooms countenance to them all dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale  its a little contest martin and i have she would begin gaily carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course they entered the bedroom and dolores said nothing 	romance
1151	 you were in a hurry werent you martin would have liked to break the mans neck now martin heard himself give a snort of mock good nature with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth ready to begin its a little contest never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment 	romance
1152	but martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything dolores kept picking up any of his clothes except the fatal shorts which he left about but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers in his moments of worst agony martin imagined what his friends were saying he had thought her exactly what he wanted 	romance
1153	pursuing his idea he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself his mind scurried frantically seeking an exit alternately he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly morosely to live out his life in this fashion nothing would change nothing would ever change 	romance
1154	in a frenzy of excitement he considered his plan beside his shorts he would place something of hers instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory for if she picked up say a pair of her panties she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside the expenditure of energy was almost the same he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor furthermore he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly every time he went in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere or maybe a girdle next to his shorts 	romance
1155	martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story the tale he thought would become less gay she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness his lack of control his general male looseness while she remained cool airy and untouched the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he believed in it since his courage and virility were involved because it was truly his 	romance
1156	the next morning while dolores was out of the room he went to her bureau drawer took out a pair of nylon lace pants and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared to his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two garments slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers then hesitated for about a second ah he thought shes going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too 	romance
1157	extending her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and swiftly left the room she did not look at him but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady they breakfasted together but martin did not refer to his triumph and dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible as he relaxed that day martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks he found that he no longer hated dolores he knew how much he had hated her and he was surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling 	romance

1160	probably mr willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren gerry began to aid freddy with her father prodded no doubt by joans open contempt for freddy and williams irritating competency another factor must have been the eventual disposal of willis fortune she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with freddy the more likely he was to reward freddy richly upon his death whatever the reasons willis and bryan started expanding zenith 	romance
1161	since they were hunting for national defense contracts adam herberet a man of surprising resources entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections feeling his power freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer heavy industry slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers attracted him the allstates auto company a mediumsized firm which manufactured fourwheeldrive vehicles and other offroad equipment had recently constructed an overlarge modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders it was ripe for amalgamation and freddys instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash and never mind inevitable consequences 	romance
1162	at that point william came into the picture although not much desiring the account he had been appointed advertising head of zenith freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner his work in new york had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure and if he wasnt entirely committed to what he did he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities mr willis eager to have him allied with the family wanted advice beyond the confines of his field and william set out on a serious study of the situation including trips to wisconsin and washington 	romance
1163	i know a guy named jack hamrick a very bright young engineer who was with chrysler and i took him with me to allstates its his expert opinion that the plant isnt well suited to what you have in mind besides that im acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the air force i think adam herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side missiles have thrown everything up for grabs and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here 	romance

1166	 one shouldnt mix commercial affairs with patriarchy but in this case i have no choice im most grateful to you so grateful i wish you were my principal aide instead of freddy not to williams surprise freddy adam and hamilton richert prevailed allied to them was gerry devoting much time to swaying her father and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william was unwilling to interfere further zenith absorbed allstates stock transfers were arranged and freddy became president of the hyphenated combination 	romance
1167	he forgot about az till unhappily he and hamrick were proved correct freddys backing dropped away from him and mr willis was forced to make up the deficit adam beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation couldnt deliver from his end the wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant stock willis held in abundance fell sharply in value 	romance
1168	 you were right he said you and your engineer and im in something of a bind in addition to other defects im a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment will you see if you can help me william spent a long week end closeted with hamrick his recent experience in motor car advertising a love for cars of themselves the existence of azs useless wisconsin setup exposure to exciting conceptions of hamricks that nobody would buy and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but outdated smallcar manufacturer called ticonderoga motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it 	romance
1169	he thought the financing the advertising the production of new models the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult if az could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment if william could hit precisely the right promotion note if the money hurdle was not insurmountable they took nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics and put their arguments down in black and white taking hamrick with him william went to mr willis he was surprised and dubious but impressed by the engineer and the report 	romance

1684	there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva the deadlock has been caused by the russians new demand for a threeman east west and neutral directorate and thus a veto over the control machinery in the u s strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing mr kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament 	news
1685	the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent moreover moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies including the u n secretariat and the international control commission for laos mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting 	news
1686	in cuba the u s had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep in laos the picture was almost equally bad u s willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized on soviet terms beyond that allied disagreement about military intervention in laos despite warnings that they might do so allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the procommunist forces as a result the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure 	news
1687	ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leaders mood was cocky and aggressive he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may # made new inquiries through the u s embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future mr kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may ## after consultation with the allies 	news
1688	firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week apparently at the insistence of the u s the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting  the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries the meeting will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned ##yearold veteran of the cold war who in mr kennedys own words is shrewd tough vigorous wellinformed and confident and a ##yearold president his birthday is may ## with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy 	news
1689	the approval did not arise from an expectation of farreaching agreements at vienna the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause 	news
1690	premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway this time the initiative came in part at least from washington there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity finally there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the presidents making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord 	news
1691	if tests are to be resumed the argument went it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse after cuba and laos it was argued mr khrushchev will interpret the presidents consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness perhaps even panic and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds moreover the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of americas firm foreign policy commitments the question was raised for example as to what attitude the president would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east 	news
1692	the shell which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended to cancel out the possibility of future development though this may or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence 	news
1693	viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy official encouragement is one thing but the downtoearth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds american catholics have responded generously to bishops and pastors appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning 	news
1694	diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility all of this may be understandable enough it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise yet for better or for worse the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible to understand the past history and the future potential of american catholic higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community 	news
1695	a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the wellsprings of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship american catholic colleges and universities are in a very real sense the product of private enterprise the private enterprise of religious communities had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees 	news
1696	this familycommunity spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas i think for example of three womens colleges with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university which is also coeducational this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot 	news
1697	for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would seem that todays need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its pursuit of excellence at the earlier preacademic excellence stage of catholic education the operation could be conducted on an intramural community basis but with todays demand for professional qualifications and specialized training the need for outsiders becomes more pressing the problem is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but that a different brand is called for commenting on the earlier stage the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decisionmaking noted that the term teacheremployee as opposed to eg maintenance employee was a not inapt description 	news
1698	and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are in their opinion identified with its highest good and to use that oftrepeated phrase the attainment of excellence the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to the organization which actually owns the university this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clericallay tension but in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one 	news
1699	there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession much given to attending meetings and conferences expressions of even lowkey dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere 	news
1700	much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the family just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions 	news
1701	broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the laymans reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation 	news
1702	this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with highsounding titles but no real authority in the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be faked competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to preset conclusions without destroying the students illusion that they are making their own decisions 	news
1703	in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all in the notre dame report reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to luncheontable communication in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy ie members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the antimonopoly laws once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the antimonopoly laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally 	news

1873	the expedition that had discovered ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand siddo words with an equal number of american words the description of the siddo syntax was very restricted and as hal found out obviously mistaken in many cases his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen yet if he used all of the little means at his disposal he would be instructing his students wrongly 	science_fiction
1874	for one thing the organs of speech of the ozagen natives differed somewhat from earthmens the sounds made by these organs were therefore dissimilar it was true that they could be approximated but would the ozagenians understand these approximations another obstacle was the grammatical construction of siddo instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future siddo used an entirely different word 	science_fiction
1875	the same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses plus the fact that siddo not only had the normal to earthmen three genders of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual fortunately gender was inflected though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in siddo the system of indicating gender varied according to tense all the other parts of speech nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs 	science_fiction
1876	no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer what gabriel was being asked to do now however was to reexamine all his basic assumptions make valuejudgments on them and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives this is not wholly a reasoning process a computer cannot do it all and even in an angel it takes time  or perhaps especially in an angel whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause however did not make it seem any less long to jack 	science_fiction
1877	there was nothing he could do but wait  we misjudged you he said slowly  we had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice of course we have before us the example of the great races at the galactic center individually they are nearly as mortal as you the difference does not seem very marked to us where it exists 	science_fiction
1878	we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half  for now it is clear that we were in the wrong you may reclaim your property and the penalty on hesperus is lifted  i did not perceive this essential distinction either firstborn hesperus said at once i was only practicing a concept that jack taught me called a deal jack what is the nature of this concept 	science_fiction
1879	 we regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what he has given his heart he discovered was pounding  for instance hesperus agreed to help me find my property and i agreed to take him to earth between individuals this process is called bargaining when it is done between races or nations it is called making a treaty 	science_fiction
1880	recovering the property was much less important though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give us  hesperus and lucifer jack said show that we do but this one was not nearly as long  then it is a matter of pleasure 	science_fiction
1881	but you should understand jack that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery visiting the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older  all the more reason then jack said why we must have a treaty we will gladly entertain your young and give them proper living quarters in return for their help in running our fusion reactors but we must know if this is in accordance with your customs and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hands to our hurt 	science_fiction
1882	jack felt a wave of complete elation but in a second it had vanished without a trace what gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments and contract to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless of the applicable earth laws the angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the earthmen but they had no faintest notion of mans perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature the simple treaty principle that gabriel was asking him to ratify in short was nothing less than total trust and it might be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war 	science_fiction
1883	almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion not trust as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders the history of disarmament agreements for instance had been unreassuringly dismal but the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban and a sort of provisional acceptance of each others good intentions on this limited question out of that agreement though not by any easy road eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations suspicion between member states still existed but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentiethcentury rivalry between arizona and california over water supplies 	science_fiction
1884	the trouble with them was that they almost never worked and in fact an agreement in principle historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled suppose that this one were to work there was no question in jacks mind of the good faith on one side at least in fact it had to be tried it would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had ever signed 	science_fiction
1885	but there was no small way to handle this one he turned back to the screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his lips for a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw it seemed to be only a riot of color light and meaningless activity gradually he realized that the pentagon of angel elders had vanished and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up 	science_fiction
1886	 you cant see them yet jack theyll be in range in a short while jack scanned the skies the boards and the skies again no there was a tiny pip on the radar if that was the skiff it was making unprecedented speed 	science_fiction
1887	through the telescope jack could see that both spacesuits were still attached to it the sail was still unfurled though there were a good many holes in it as langer had predicted would be the case by now it was a startling almost numenous sight but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous cometstail of angels the skiff was not heading for the nursery however 	science_fiction
1888	and there would be no chance of signaling them without the nernst generator jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone fuming helpless he watched them pass him the sail ragged though it was still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars he would never have believed without seeing it that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast and why was it causing so much agitation among the angels and being followed by so many of them 	science_fiction
1889	the curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldnt be argued with however the skiff was headed for the very center of the nebula toward that place which jack knew now could hold nothing less important than the very core of the angels life and religion it was clear that langer had at last found a way to attract the angels attention it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off langer would have to be headed off whether he knew where he was going or not 	science_fiction
1890	but not having talked to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line had he decided perhaps that the center of the cloud was a center of government instead of a center of life and faith but it didnt matter now whether he meant to invade the holy of holies or was simply headed in that direction by accident if it was intentional it was now also unnecessary and whether intentional or not the outcome would be disastrous 	science_fiction
1891	when he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses however he hesitated he had to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he had to have it fast but fusion power in the coal sack was what had triggered all the trouble in the first place and he already had an angel aboard  im going to turn my generator back on as i promised to do but i cant take you to earth yet 	science_fiction
1892	will you obstruct this or will you help i know its not part of the bargain and your elders might not like it  nobody else can live in your hearth while i am in it hesperus said promptly  as for my elders they have already admitted that they were wrong if because of this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permitted to go there at all 	science_fiction
1893	without an instants transition the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board always before it had taken five minutes to from here on out the ariadne was going to be hotter than any space cruiser man had ever dreamed of but since he had failed to anticipate it he lost the five minutes anyhow in plotting an intercept orbit  hesperus dont use this ttau vector trick of yours please 	science_fiction
1894	he rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw  ekstrohm nogol you guys okay  nothing wrong with me that couldnt be cured nogol said he didnt say what would cure him he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself 	science_fiction
1895	 well lets take a groundlevel look at the country around here a range of bluffs hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss above them the sky was the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above minneapolis seen against neonlit snow that cold empty sky was full of fire and light it seemed almost a magnification of the galaxy itself of the milky way blown up by some master photographer 	science_fiction
1896	these planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of them did this would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of yancy# in three generations they lay months away from the nearest earth star by jump drive and no one knew what they were good for although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered much like the continent of antarctica in ancient history  how can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely 	science_fiction
1897	 some can be lonely in a crowd nogol said elaborately  what will we need outside ryan  no helmets the captain answered  we can breathe out there all right this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago 	science_fiction
1898	think theyre intelligent maybe hostile  i think theyre dead ekstrohm interjected quietly  i get no readings from them at all sonic electronic galvanic all blank according to these needles theyre stone dead 	science_fiction
1899	 you hold down the fort nogol  i heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldnt get an encephalographic reading on him me i know the mind of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner  im not worried about you misreading the dials nogol just about a lug like you reading them at all remember when the little hand is straight up thats negative 	science_fiction
1900	ryan told him what he could do then ekstrohm smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall the strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects actually the types of infection that could attack a warmblooded mammal were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories he wasnt likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever 	science_fiction
1901	it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow they walked from midnight to noon noon to midnight and came to the beast sprawled on its side  hey this is pretty close to a warthog  one of the best matches ive ever found still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world 	science_fiction
1902	the big man seldom gave out with such thoughts  what shall we do with this one ryan nudged it with his toe following ekstrohms example it sure as hell doesnt look like any dominant intelligent species to me of course thats not definite proof 	science_fiction
1903	 i think wed better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here in the meantime we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent  it looks like we did when we made blastdown  but what about our landing was lethal to the creatures  the planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output 	science_fiction
1904	maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and dont have any rs stored up they could take a lot without harm  then maybe it was the shockwave we set up they curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien like a spaceship  at this stage of the game anything could be possible but theres one possibility i particularly dont like 	science_fiction
1905	suppose it is something right on the planet native to it i just hope it doesnt work on earthmen too ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet there was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being 	science_fiction
1906	ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on yancey# ### there was a keening of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground insects there were on the world but they were frozen solid during the night only to revive and thaw in the morning sun the bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum 	science_fiction
1907	he threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk to the floor there was no longer any need to hide he no longer had to lie in his bunk all night his eyes closed pretending to sleep in privacy he could walk around leave the light on read some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this 	science_fiction
1908	others admitted he was absolutely correct he never slept his body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons occasionally he fell into a waking grittyeyed stupor naturally he couldnt let his shipmates know this insomnia would ground him from the exploration service on physiological if not psychological grounds 	science_fiction
1909	since he couldnt sleep anyway he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports where the hell did he get off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain a man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him in a camp instead of shipboard hiding the secret was easier but the secret itself was just as hard 	science_fiction
1910	he scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldnt seem to concentrate on the weighty pontifical ponderous style on impulse he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air behind him his mates stirred without waking ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble 	science_fiction
1911	the angry burntred face of ryan greeted him  okay stormy this isnt the place for fun and games what did you do with them all the dead animals laying around the ship  what are you talking about ryan 	science_fiction
1912	all i know is that they are gone ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze  ill be damned ekstrohm said expe doesnt like anybody mucking up primary evidence 	science_fiction
1913	 why pick me for your patsy this has got to be some kind of local phenomenon why accuse a shipmate of being behind this  listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of every doubt but you arent exactly the model of a surveyor you know 	science_fiction
1914	 no ekstrohm said no i didnt know that  youve been hiding things from me and nogol every jump weve made with you it fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth youve been involved in  what could i do with your lousy dead bodies what would i want with them 	science_fiction
1915	now all the bodies are missing like they got up and walked away it was not a new experience to ekstrohm  ryan there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies i give you my word im not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition take my word cant you 	science_fiction
1916	i outweigh you fifty pounds and im fast for a big man why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong for her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant she was not alone for there were three other such children in the big citys special nursery soon they all were removed to central laboratory school where their delicate transformation began 	science_fiction
1917	instead of kicking feet helvas neural responses started her wheels instead of grabbing with hands she manipulated mechanical extensions as she matured more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship for helva was destined to be the brain half of a scout ship partnered with a man or a woman whichever she chose as the mobile half she would be among the elite of her kind 	science_fiction
1918	as long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations and there were no sideeffects from the pituitary tinkering helva would live a rewarding rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary normal being however no diagram of her brain patterns no early iq tests recorded certain essential facts about helva that central must eventually learn they would have to bide their official time and see trusting that the massive doses of shellpsychology would suffice her too as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships brain ships were of course long past the experimental stages 	science_fiction
1919	and very very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were but the welloriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the universe so for happy years helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates playing such games as stall powerseek studying her lessons in trajectory propulsion techniques computation logistics mental hygiene basic alien psychology philology space history law traffic codes all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning logical informed citizen not so obvious to her but of more importance to her teachers helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid she would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the subconsciouslevel instruction 	science_fiction
1920	one such group got all incensed over shelled children when helva was just turning fourteen when they were forced to central worlds shrugged its shoulders arranged a tour of the laboratory schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories complete with photographs very few committees ever looked past the first few photos most of their original objections about shells were overridden by the relief that these hideous to them bodies were mercifully concealed helvas class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program 	science_fiction
1921	her subject was large a copy of the last supper and her canvas small the head of a tiny screw she had tuned her sight to the proper degree as she worked she absentmindedly crooned producing a curious sound shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths helvas hum then had a curious vibrancy a warm dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings 	science_fiction
1922	helva looked up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular dirty craters on a flaky pink surface she instinctively regulated her sight until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores assumed normal proportions  yes we have quite a few years of voice training madam remarked helva calmly  vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intrastellar distances and must be eliminated although this was the first time that helva had seen unshelled people she took this experience calmly 	science_fiction
1923	 i meant that you have a nice singing voice dear the lady amended would you like to see my work she instinctively sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further meditation  i am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw  no i say the lady twittered 	science_fiction
1924	 of course some of my color values do not match the old masters and the perspective is faulty but i believe it to be a fair copy the ladys eyes unmagnified bugged out  oh i forget and helvas voice was really contrite if she could have blushed she would have  you people dont have adjustable vision 	science_fiction
1925	 here this will help suggested helva substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last supper on the head of a screw  well remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife the good lord can eat where angels fear to tread  are you referring sir asked helva politely to the dark age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin  if you substitute atom for angel the problem is not insoluble given the metallic content of the pin in question 	science_fiction
1926	 did they remember to program a sense of humor as well young lady  we are directed to develop a sense of proportion sir which contributes the same effect the good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time if the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school they left helva with a morsel as well  singing as applicable to herself required research 	science_fiction
1927	but singing for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis balanced properly between optimism and practicality the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves their ships and personnel from bizarre situations therefore to helva the problem that she couldnt open her mouth to sing among other restrictions did not bother her she would work out a method bypassing her limitations whereby she could sing 	science_fiction
1928	her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice shell people did not strictly speaking breathe for their purposes oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells after experimentation helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone 	science_fiction
1929	she compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them not at all unharmonious merely unique acquiring a repertoire from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall she found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy it would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo soprano and coloratura as she pleased it was to helva only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted 	science_fiction
1930	shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship the aj her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship the neural audio visual and sensory connections were made and sealed her extendibles were diverted connected or augmented and the final delicatebeyonddescription brain taps were completed while helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings 	science_fiction
1931	her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine her first actual flight for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner there were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day helva was commissioned 	science_fiction
1932	consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective partners had there been another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would have been guided to make the first move as it was while central wrangled among itself robert tanner sneaked out of the pilots barracks out to the field and over to helvas slim metal hull  hello anyone at home  of course replied helva logically activating her outside scanners 	science_fiction
1933	 all you have to do is ask he retorted hopefully i thought perhaps there were no partners available and ive had no directives from central even to herself helva sounded a little selfpitying but the truth was she was lonely sitting on the darkened field always she had had the company of other shells and more recently technicians by the score the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive 	science_fiction
1934	it would have killed you in the cabin do you have anything for me mercer stammered not knowing what bdikkat meant and the twonosed man answered for him i think he has a nice baby head but it isnt big enough for you to take yet mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm bdikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the supercondamine hit mercer 	science_fiction
1935	he stumbled and fell but it did not hurt the woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming it was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did the two women babbled and crooned at him 	science_fiction
1936	with most of his mind he was happy he wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this he tried to tell the lady da but the words werent quite straight a painful stab hit him in the abdomen the drug went after the pain and swallowed it 	science_fiction
1937	the pain was gone though it had been crippling the first time he rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert that was a good bite the lady da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position said she im strong too we can die too we can die like real people 	science_fiction
1938	with this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack he was wide awake but he did not feel like doing anything in that beautiful place among all those companionable and attractive people he sat and smiled mercer wondered how long the supercondamine had lasted him he endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement 	science_fiction
1939	he watched his own body with remote casual interest the lady da and the handcovered woman stayed near him after a long time the halfman dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at them and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged mercer saw the sun rise on occasion closed his eyes briefly and opened them to see stars shining 	science_fiction
1940	the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body at last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain he knew all the events which could take place on shayol he remembered them well from his happy period formerly he had noticed them now he felt them 	science_fiction
1941	she smiled at him with benign remote happiness apparently her many torsos stretched out along the ground had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body she meant him well but was in no condition for articulate speech the halfman lay on the ground arteries pulsating prettily behind the halftransparent film which protected his abdominal cavity the halfman woke recognized mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin 	science_fiction
1942	did you ever see a play  you mean a game with cards  no said the halfman a sort of eyemachine with real people doing the figures  i never saw that said mercer but i  but you want to ask me when bdikkat is going to come back with the needle 	science_fiction
1943	we all know what is going to happen we all know when it is going to happen we all know what the dummies will do he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated men were cradled and we all know what the new people will ask but we never know how long a scene is going to take  whats a scene 	science_fiction
1944	the halfman laughed with something close to real humor a scene is just a part of a play i mean we know the order in which things happen but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and theres not much climate here so none of us know how long anything takes the pain seems short and the pleasure seems long im inclined to think that they are about two earthweeks each 	science_fiction
1945	the halfman received a dromozootic implant turned red in the face shouted senselessly at mercer take it out you fool when mercer looked on helplessly the halfman twisted over on his side his pink dusty back turned to mercer and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself mercer himself could not tell how long it was before bdikkat came back once again bdikkat moved among them like a father this time bdikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of mercers thigh a sleeping childs head covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes 	science_fiction
1946	he saw the childface grimace as the head was cut he felt the far cool flash of unimportant pain as bdikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately the next time it was two legs growing from his chest then there had been another head beside his own or was that after the torso and legs waist to toetips of the little girl which had grown from his side 	science_fiction
1947	in between teratologies she was a pretty and shapely woman but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him repeated some thousands of time repeated with smiles and hope people never live forever she found this immensely comforting even though mercer did not make much sense out of it thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and new ones arrived sometimes bdikkat took the new ones resting in the everlasting sleep of their burnedout brains in a groundtruck to be added to other herds 	science_fiction
1948	finally mercer did manage to follow bdikkat to the door of the cabin he had to fight the bliss of supercondamine to do it only the memory of previous hurt bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask bdikkat when he mercer was happy the answer would no longer be available when he needed it fighting pleasure itself he begged bdikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there bdikkat grudgingly agreed but he did not come out of the doorway 	science_fiction
1949	when he said it they thought it exceedingly profound though none of them understood it since it was simply the amount of time that mercer had been on shayol  standard years eightyfour years seven months three days two hours eleven and one half minutes the secret little corner of his mind which stayed sane through happiness and pain made him wonder about bdikkat what persuaded the cowman to remain on shayol was bdikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day surrounded by a family of little cowpeople resembling himself 	science_fiction
1950	he remembered the last time he had eaten actual eggs from an actual pan the dromozoa kept him alive but he did not know how they did it the lady da naked in the dusty plain waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her there were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less the years if they were years went by 	science_fiction
1951	those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of captain alvarez there was night and day but no setting of crops no change of season no generations of men time stood still for these people and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the lady da took on very remote meaning her statement was a hope not a truth in which they could believe they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all 	science_fiction
1952	though they saw the oldstyle chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond bdikkats cabin they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh far long ago some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter mercer read it and so had a few of the others but they could not tell which man had done it the letter scraped on stone had been a message home they could still read the opening once i was like you stepping out of my window at the end of day and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place i lived in 	science_fiction
