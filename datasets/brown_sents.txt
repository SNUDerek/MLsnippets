as a result although we still make use of this distinction there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed just what is meant by spirit and by matter the terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do for in the modern world neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreedupon elements of experience 
when the words are used we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true demons fairies angels and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars 
in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general which now cause us much difficulty could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time 
in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions there have been indeed many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful all this has not however been an unmixed blessing the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means or at best with wholly inadequate means for dealing with his experience of spirit 
we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality as we know and apprehend it with respect to which we can refer this experience science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur millers play the crucible which deals with the salem witch trials as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century 
the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures foibles irritations and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people instead the audience can sit back at ease and from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion a teenage girl abigail williams is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle the reverend samuel parris about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night the demon world is populated with real creatures and witches actually can be seen flying through the air 
everyone in salem saint and sinner alike is swept up by it it is like a mysterious epidemic which starting first with abigail and parris spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it it grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery moral disintegration and destruction the audience leaves the play under a spell it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes if one asks about this play what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power there is no better answer to give than spirit 
in the end the good man john proctor expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says a fire a fire is burning i hear the boot of lucifer i see his filthy face the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this yet are not we of the midtwentieth century who rightly do not believe there is any such thing as the devil just as bad off as they only in a different way 
we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false even mr miller himself seems uncertain on this score in a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play he says at one point however that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifers manyfaced lieutenants and his belief is not to his discredit better minds than hales were and still are convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken 
the concept of unity in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force in which good and evil are relative everchanging and always joined to the same phenomenon such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of mans worthlessness until redeemed the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or churchstate apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over salem it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power 
for this does not account for the integral elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell the reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the authors convictions to the contrary there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit apart from spirit there could be no community for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity cohesiveness and permanence think for example of the spirit of the marine corps 
we cannot of course assign it any substance it is not material and is not a thing occupying space and time yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known so it is too with many other spirits which we all know the spirit of nazism or communism school spirit the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan every community if it is alive has a spirit and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity 
for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere it is the spirit which is the source of a communitys drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas 
the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them it is for them a given which they and they alone possess the spirit of the marine corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it it is they of course who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruits to find as they come into it if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be understanded of the people and this it must not be forgotten is one of the goals of the perennial theological task there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation 
the absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents bultmanns intention his point is not that mythology may not be used but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the christian kerygma when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding of existence mythological concepts may by all means still be used but they can be used responsibly only as symbols or ciphers that is only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological or existential terms the statement is often made that when bultmann argues in this way he overestimates the intellectual stumblingblock which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the christian faith 
nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated on the contrary even in the heart of the bible belt itself as can be attested by any one who is called to work there the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way together with the corresponding changes in mans picture of himself and his world in fact it is in just such a situation that the profundity of bultmanns argument is disclosed although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class 
the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme cultureprotestantism so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the american churches in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand and this usually means one or another of the various forms of folk religion current in the situation this is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent peales cult of reassurance or the other types of a purely cultural christianity is the everpresent need for a demythologized gospel but it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected however even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace 
but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation can the church risk assuming that the folly of men is as dear to god as their wisdom or as is also commonly implied that the foolishness of god and the foolishness of men are simply two ways of talking about the same thing can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose cooperation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church which derives however from the heritage of the greeks rather than from the bible that god is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world by analogy the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church 
and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume as we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends in arguing in this way we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction but the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable 
if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no or where i do not have the right to say anything at all then my only choice is to refuse to be a christian expressed differently if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ is some form of selfdestruction whether of the body or of the mind sacrificium corporis sacrificium intellectus then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter modern man as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us has come of age and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is in fact marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation it is still a positive step forward 
in any event it is an irreversible step and if we are at all honest with ourselves we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us to say this of course is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years or at any rate since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought we have aligned ourselves with that liberal tradition in protestant christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of schleiermacher ritschl herrmann harnack and troeltsch and more recently schweitzer and the early barth and in part at least bultmann it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong for we must number here not only the names of bushnell clarke and rauschenbusch not to mention those of the chicago school and macintosh but those of the brothers niebuhr and if america may claim him 
what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity they have insisted rather on living fully and completely within modern culture and so far from considering this treason to god have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him when we say then that today in our situation the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement however much we may have to criticize liberal theologys constructive formulations the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism not behind it 
for we have said in effect that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion only one is really an alternative if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally the position of the right is clearly untenable whereas bultmanns center position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone the general position of the right as represented say by karl barth involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered it follows then provided the possibilities have been exhausted that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the left which has been represented on the continent by fritz buri and to some extent at least is found in much that is significant in american and english theology in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible we may develop this argument at greater length 
to do this it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless question thus if what is at issue is whether all s is p it is indifferent whether some s is not p or no s is p since in either case the judgment in question is false hence if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted for in either event the first possibility is excluded therefore the only conceivable alternatives are those represented on the one hand by the two at least apparently selfconsistent but mutually exclusive positions of buri and barth and on the other hand by the third but really pseudo position analogous to a round square of bultmann 
 # accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation and # in so doing frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by means of statements that from bultmanns point of view are mythological one hundred years ago there existed in england the association for the promotion of the unity of christendom representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman and anglican churches and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome this association produced little fruit and in fact was condemned by the holy office in #### now again in #### in england there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as christian unity 
many people seem hopeful yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in #### than there was in #### but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope at least on the catholic side for the tide is well on the turn as the london catholic weekly universe has written i came to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman as an american catholic of irish ancestry i came with certain preconceptions and expectations 
since arriving here however i have formed a far different religious picture of presentday england in representing part of this new picture i will be recounting some of my own personal experiences reactions and judgments but my primary aim is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the present religious state of england since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit my roman collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman catholic cleric in any case i have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by englishmen even in devonshire and cornwall where anticatholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest 
on my first guy fawkes day here i found catholics as well as noncatholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day a birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled the true story of guy fawkes which began  when you pile your guy on the bonfire tomorrow night i wonder how much of the true story of guy fawkes you will remember in the ### years since the first guy fawkes night much of the story has been forgotten so here is a reminder the article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill king james # 
the return of the catholic hierarchy in #### was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and in fact was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty in #### newman professedly had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers now in #### the catholic population of england is still quite small ten per cent or # million yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population a protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham oratory catholic church on sunday mornings 
she may not have been exact on this number but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university following anglican evensong at which there was a congregation of twelve he celebrated mass before more than a hundred the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches according to a newspaper report of the #### statistics of the church of england the total of confirmed members is ####### but only ####### are registered on the parochial church rolls and over ## million people in england are baptized into the church of england but roughly only a tenth of them continue 
a further ### anglican churches have been demolished since #### and in the last five years the methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or more often the sale of ### chapels most of these former churches are now used as warehouses but neither anglicans nor nonconformists object to selling churches to roman catholics and have done so while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period and that religious population shifts have emptied churches a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are going to church it should be admitted too that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics one paper writes ## per cent 
an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true a century ago newman saw that liberalism what we now might call secularism would gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism and that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own that day is perhaps today #### and it seems no longer very meaningful to call england a protestant country one of the ironies of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not relatively speaking many real christians to unite many english catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy 
with traditional nationalistic spirit some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism at its best i have found myself saying with other foreigners here that english catholics are good catholics it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses at mass they hope of course to reclaim the noncatholic population to the catholic faith and at every sunday benediction they recite by heart the prayer for england  o blessed virgin mary mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother look down in mercy upon england thy dowry and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee 
 a hymn often to be heard in catholic churches is faith of our fathers which glories in englands ancient faith that endured persecution and which proclaims faith of our fathers marys prayers shall win our country back to thee the english saints are widely venerated quite naturally and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs and cardinal newman will soon be canonized because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers english catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being unenglish i have not seen this charge made during my stay here but apparently it is still in the air for example a writer in a recent number of the queen hyperbolically states that of the myriad imprecations the only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are unenglish 
one of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid##th century is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics partly because religious tests were removed only in #### moreover for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs now not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at oxford but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the noncatholic members of the university catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the cherwell with noncatholic students 
the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant churches on successive sundays during october #### paul ferris a noncatholic wrote articles in the observer depicting clergymen of the church of england the church of rome and the nonconformist church the catholic priest though somewhat superficially drawn easily came out the best there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of midvictorian england 
catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergymen a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool dr heenan and the anglican archbishop of york dr ramsey recently appointed archbishop of canterbury the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in england the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months and it was interesting to observe that bbcs television film on christmas eve was the bells of st marys 
it was the first time an english primate has done this since the ##th century english catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope almost daily something is reported which feeds this catholic hope in england statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and irish catholic immigrants news of a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit a report that a catholic nun had been requested to teach in a noncatholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters 
a report that ### protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive mass offered for christian unity at a catholic church in slough during the church unity octave the death of a man is unique and yet it is universal the straight line would symbolize its uniqueness the circle its universality but how can one figure symbolize both christianity declares that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal concur 
to be the savior and the lord jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with mans history yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind his history is his alone yet each man must recognize his own history in it his death is his alone yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus 
not a circle then nor a straight line but a spiral represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence as represented by a spiral history may in some sense be said to repeat itself the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam as origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ 
from gods will and wisdom and from virgin earth for god had not rained says the scripture before man was made and there was no man to till the earth from this earth then while it was still virgin god took dust and fashioned the man the beginning of humanity irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals but as universal human beings who were and are all of humanity adam and eve were perfect not in the sense that they possessed perfection but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection 
therefore there is no need for him as there is for origen to identify existence itself with the fall existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence of a preexistent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history the biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words so god created man in his own image in the similitude of god he created him there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguished so most notably in the statement if the holy spirit is absent from the soul such a man is indeed of an animal nature 
thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster the similitude of god by contrast is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature recent research on irenaeus however makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction he does not mean to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall for he was created not exactly immortal nor yet exactly mortal but capable of immortality as well as of mortality 
and he laid down for him certain conditions so that if he kept the command of god then he would always remain as he was that is immortal but if he did not he would become mortal melting into earth whence his frame had been taken these conditions man did not keep and thus he became mortal yet he did not stop being human as a result there is no justification for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of god humanity and the similitude of god immortality 
he was in the words of irenaeus beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality the true way to immortality lay through obedience but man did not believe this for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin and even as she having indeed a husband adam but being nevertheless as yet a virgin having become disobedient was made the cause of death both to herself and to the entire human race so also did mary having a man betrothed to her and being nevertheless a virgin by yielding obedience become the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race 
his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin mary that parallelism affects his picture of mans disobedience too for as it was christ the word of god who came to rescue man so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought death into the world and all our woe with this act of disobedience and not with the inception of his individual existence man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality at the nadir of that circuit is death 
wherefore as they became forfeit to death from that moment they were handed over to it this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed namely on a friday as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday he sees a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath in any case though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree they obtained mortality instead mans life originally shaped for immortality and for communion with god must now be conformed to the shape of death 
even death therefore has a providential as well as a punitive function  wherefore also he god drove him man out of paradise and removed him far from the tree of life not because he envied him the tree of life as some venture to assert but because he pitied him and did not desire that he should continue a sinner for ever nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal and evil interminable and irremediable but he set a bound to his state of sin by interposing death and thus causing sin to cease putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh which should take place in the earth so that man ceasing at length to live in sin and dying to it might live to god this idea which occurs in both tatian and cyprian fits especially well into the scheme of irenaeus theology for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ 
it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is it is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam who does indeed come to destroy sin but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality this emphasis upon death rather than sin as mans fundamental problem irenaeus shares with many early theologians especially the greekspeaking ones they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility which can mean though it does not have to mean deliverance from time and history 
it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated but they dare not be confused or identified the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older in short whether adams life was intended to be part of the process of time if it was then it must have been gods intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity 
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal the embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change on the other hand christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence it is the wages of sin and its sting is the law if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator 
if death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal ie created existence such an interpretation of death radically alters the christian view of creation for it teaches salvation from not salvation in time and history because christianity teaches not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ furthermore as an encouragement to revisionist thinking it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes 
ezra stiles gannett an honorable representative of the sanhedrin addressed himself frankly to the issue in #### insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist even so gannett judiciously argued the association could legitimately decide that parker should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness we today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations one can even argue though this is a delicate matter that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture to the first church and so to suppress it rather than let parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it finally it did seem clear as day to these clergymen as gannetts son explained in the biography of his father they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of christians 
grant all this still when modern unitarianism and the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults parker lavished upon them or else argue that after all parker received the treatment he invited they betray an uneasy conscience whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of parker and the fraternity on january ## #### while it may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker leave the association while it may plead that dr n l frothingham had every warrant for stating the difference between trinitarians and unitarians is a difference in christianity the difference between mr parker and the association is a difference between no christianity and christianity despite these supposed conclusive assurances the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief of positive thanksgiving that the association never quite brought itself officially to expel parker had it done so the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible nor could the harvard divinity school assemble today to honor parkers insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying peccavi happily for posterity then the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality 
whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room though not out of the fellowship in the hall after adjournment dr frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested parker to visit him whereupon our burly theodore again burst into tears all this near tragedy which to us borders on comedy enables us to tell the story over and over again always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency it was indeed a near thing but somehow the inherent decency of new england which we inherit did triumph to the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it 
in both cases the stubborn fact remains liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates both legitimate offspring of its loins and when brought to the test it behaved shabbily suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about however there is a crucial difference between the two histories emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside or rather by leaving it behind him he walked out of the unitarian communion so that it could lick the wound of his departure preserve its selfrespect and eventually accord him pious veneration 
hence he was in his lifetime as is the memory of him afterwards a canker within the liberal sensitivity he still points an accusing finger at all of us telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat actually the dispute between parker and the society of his time both ecclesiastical and social was a real one a bitter one it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of selfdeprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him the fact is incontestable that liberal world of unitarian boston was narrowminded intellectually sterile smug afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened 
nevertheless we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace their passions were genuine and the division between them and the abolitionists is clearcut but parker as the ultraliberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom even though his theological theses have become to us commonplaces the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us it has been endlessly rephrased but i may here put it thus at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant 
there can be no doubt the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior the gentle channing revered by all bostonians orthodox or unitarian wrote to a friend in louisville that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action no city in the world is governed so little by a police and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment we stand more in awe of one another than most people opinion is less individual or runs more into masses and often rules with a rod of iron even more poignantly and with the insight of a genius channing added remember this is channing not parker 
channing wrote this in a letter i think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons but theodore parker commencing his mission to the worldatlarge disguised as the minister of a twentyeighth congregational church which bore no resemblance to the congregational polities descended from the founders among which were still the unitarian churches made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum because he spoke openly with what channing had prophesied someone might with daring hyperbole parker vindicated channings further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution and only within those defined limits a license 
he arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with at the least resentment what otherwise could the lawyer doctor minister the men of science and letters do when told that they had become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant and continually cried holy holy holy is the almighty dollar nor when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as parker snarled at them thus talk about the catholics voting as the bishop tells there are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom nor a mitre on their head who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome but to the almighty dollar a pope much nearer home boston has been controlled by a few capitalists lawyers and other managers who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think 
it was duty he said that his parents had given him as a rule beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied and it was duty he would perform though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty parker could weep and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents  if it gave me pleasure to say hard things he wrote i would shut up forever we have to tell ourselves that when parker spoke in this vein he believed what he said because he could continue but the truth which cost me bitter tears to say i must speak though it cost other tears hotter than fire because he copiously shed his own tears and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other peoples consciences 
it is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody professing the deepest piety decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the water into wine at eleven am on the third of august ad ## we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed so we are the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy to salute his courage and to pass on happily forgetting both him and the entire episode we have not the leisure or the patience or the skill to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor the majesterial andrews norton by saying that while he believed jesus like other religious teachers worked miracles i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine i have within the past fifty years come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt 
i have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world in an amateurish yet in a very real sense i have followed the developments of archaeology geology astronomy herpetology and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields at one time i became disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both old and new testaments by a higher criticism of the bible to refute which i felt the need of a better knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and like some higher critical friends trying to continue to use the bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations attempting to bridge the chasm between an older reverent bibleloving generation and a critical doubting bibleemancipated race although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book i stood outside shivering in the cold 
now if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking through his servant it is johns gospel to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the bible here i took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path to which we might give the modern name of pragmatism or the thing that works test it try it and if it works accept it as a guiding principle so i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself and then tested it to see how it worked 
the next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly science and i submitted to its conditions according to christs invitation and promise that if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself john # ## the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god son of man by the virgin mary the saviour of the world i believe therefore that we are without exception sinners by nature alienated from god and that jesus christ the son of god came to earth the representative head of a new race to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world and that he who thus receives christ as his personal saviour is born again spiritually with new privileges appetites and affections destined to live and grow in his likeness forever nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable moral life although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues i now ever look for christ according to his promises and those of the old testament as well to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth 
the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body again as faith reveals god my father and christ my saviour i follow without question where he leads me daily by his spirit of love wisdom power and prayer i place his precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to him i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge and daring to trust him even though called to stand alone before the world our lords invitation with its implied promise to all is come and see 
as i ministered to his needs i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the lord in his heart he had that peace of which the lord spoke when he said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid what a joy to realize that we too can claim this promise tendered by the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him he was about to leave them to depart from this world and return to his father in heaven 
i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lords guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients how often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room asking for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the saviour and his creatures looking unto god the prophet isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee are you longing for peace in your heart 
as only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family likewise one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are his own perhaps you do not know if you belong to him you may know that you are in gods family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father  god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that he gives his peace 
why not open your heart to the lord jesus christ now accept him as your saviour and let him fill you with peace that only he can give then with the hymn writer of old you can say  i am resting today in his wonderful peace i am kept from all danger by night and by day and his glory is flooding my soul

 as many as received him jesus to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name  the lord is my light and my salvation the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid a certain teacher scheduled a fear party for her fourth grade pupils 
the teacher thought it was so successful that she asks wouldnt it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries dr george w crane a medical columnist thinks it would he says that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously each week an estimated ## million patients call upon us doctors of this number ##% or ## million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever 
one of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days people are giving their doctors a hard time one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles and he reported that ##% of them worried about things that never happened ##% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control 
##% of them worried about their friends neighbors and relatives most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves only #% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention well most of our fears may be unfounded but after you discover that fact you have something else to worry about why then do we have these fears what is the real cause of them what is there about us that makes us so anxious 
we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers we spend billions of dollars at the race tracks and more billions on other forms of gambling we spend billions of dollars on liquor and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moments relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks and after he had seen it all he said to a friend you must be a very sad people 
he should have said jittery for thats what we are watch people flock to amusement houses cocktail lounges and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something in one of his writings pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates yes and as tension mounts in this world fear is increasing does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business 
i doubt that fear parties and group confessionals will help very much suppose we do get our fears out in the open what then isnt that where most of them are already right out on the front page of our newspapers maybe we are talking about them too much the question is what are we going to do about them 
hitler did just that ## years ago building up tensions that first led to a munich and then to a world war the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate it is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack it could have the same effect on communists the president of the united states has said we will never negotiate out of fear and we will never fear to negotiate 
and thats another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears to develop the poise that promotes peace turning to the word of god we find the only sure way to do that in psalm ## # you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you or to drive them out if they have you in their grip the lord is my light and my salvation the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid 
he didnt live in a world of perpetual peril like ours he didnt know anything about the problems we face today read the next two verses when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me in this will i be confident that is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today isnt it 
he has already devoured huge areas of the world putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire reducing them to slavery systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison yes indeed we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us what a terrible thing that wailing wall in berlin a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family another man tried to swim across the river from the east to the west but was shot and killed 
the entrance to a church has been walled up so that the congregation most of which is in the western sector cannot worship god there anymore practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city people stand at the wall giving vent to their feelings weeping pounding it with their fists pleading for loved ones but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity there is only one escape left a tragic one and too many people are taking it suicide 
these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door we are all involved in them deeply involved and there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world the lord is my light and my salvation the lord is the strength of my life 
notice that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret of his faith first the lord is my light he lived in a very dark world but he was not in the dark the same god who called this world into being when he said let there be light  those were his very first creative words he began the world with light this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness 
in fact he came into this world himself in the person of his son jesus christ who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of christ he could only see the light coming over the horizon we live in the bright daylight of that great event for us it is a fact in history 
this is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of god the lord is my salvation he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his sins if god could do that he could do anything the enemies at his gate threatening to eat up his flesh were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul and god had conquered that one by his grace 
the apostle paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him freely give us all things if god be for us who can be against us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword this is the key to the conquest of fear 
when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus christ when we know that he is our savior that he has paid our debt with his blood that he has met the demands of gods justice and thus has turned his wrath away when we know that we have peace with god in our hearts and then with this god on our side we can face the whole world without fear and so the psalmist gives us one more picture of god the lord is the strength of my life it recalls those words of another psalm god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth 
thus while it remains possible that the babylonians and/or the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years the lo shu square as an expression of centralitythe concept of the middle kingdom at peace strong and united under a forceful ruler which had been only a longedfor ideal in the time of the warring states was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese empire under the chin dynasty ###### bc but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor shih huangti in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hardwon national unity was the burning of the books in ### bc with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking 
many of the latter were destroyed in their turn during the burning of the vast chin palace some ten years later yet some must have survived because the old interest in number symbolism divination and magic persisted on into the han dynasty which succeeded in reuniting china and keeping it together for a longer period from ### bc to ad ### in fact during the first century bc an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects finding its typical expression in the socalled wei books a number of which were specifically devoted to the lo shu and related numerical diagrams especially in connection with divination however the wei books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in ### after all this destruction of old literature it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu which was already semisecret anyhow 
although modern scholars have expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three a mere mathematical puzzle was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself but up to now no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties or the numerical significance of its numbers singly or in combination and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concepts such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu # was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram the importance of this # can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers quite apart from any numerological considerations which is to say any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it indeed mathematically speaking it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram 
then if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square through multiplying it by the highest number # which is the square of the base number the result is ## and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed furthermore the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers by reason of its central position it is also their mathematical mean since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair all of which equal ## in fact the neat balance of these pairs and their subtle equilibrium would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese 
and in this square the respective pairs made up of large and small odd yang numbers and those composed of large and small even yin numbers were all equal to each other thus all differences were leveled and all contrasts erased in a realm of no distinction and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis the tremendous emphasis on the # in the lo shu square for purely mathematical reasons and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number # and why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century bc when the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions and took # as the dynastic number believing that he would thus place himself his imperial family and the nation under the most auspicious influences 
after this time inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors as well as other writings emphasized the desirability of keeping ones self at the center of the universe where cosmic forces were strongest later we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally all this emphasis on centrality and on the number # as a symbolic expression of the center which seems to have begun as far back as ### bc also may conceivably have led to the development of the fiveelements school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five we find for example such groupings as the five ancient rulers the five sacred mountains the five directions with center the five metals five colors five tastes five odors five musical notes five bodily functions five viscera and many others this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself as though they had served as the base for all the rest 
and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four obviously something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives and that may have been the workings of the lo shu this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries 
although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers this was actually only a beginning of wonders for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time as such one cannot fully understand the thought of the prehan and han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu but conversely one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese which they felt they saw expressed in it the chinese world view during the han dynasty when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity was based in large part on the teachings of the yinyang and fiveelements school which was traditionally founded by tsou yen 
heaven acting through the tao expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles the yin and the yang the yang or male principle was the source of light heat and dynamic vitality associated with the sun while the yin or female principle flourished in darkness cold and quiet inactivity and was associated with the moon together these two principles influenced all things and in varying combinations they were present in everything we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang while the even numbers were yin so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center 
instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine provinces as was usually done this equated the odd yang numbers with mountains firm and resistant hence yang and the even numbers with rivers sinuous and yielding hence yin taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china thus the middle number # represented sungshan in honan central china the # taishan in shantung east china the # hwashan in shensi west china 
and the # huoshan in anhwei which was then the south sacred mountain for the rivers the # represented the huai to the then southeast the # the san kiang three rivers in the then southwest the # the chi in the northeast and the # the upper yellow river in the northwest 
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was equated with the nine provinces and whenever the lo shu involved directional symbolism it was oriented in this same fashion few persons who join the church are insincere they earnestly desire to do the will of god 
these fatalities are dramatic evidence of halfway evangelism a failure to follow through a program of lay visitation evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship the work of lay visitation evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have been interviewed in the average situation about onethird of those visited make commitments to christ and the church the pastor and the membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program 
churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep ## to ## per cent of their new members loyal and active this is the answer to the problem of membership delinquency it is important that persons desiring to unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant it is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications preparation for church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received 
some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors it should not be postponed later than the next day a helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference if possible he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present 
he will discuss the significance of christian commitment the necessity of family religion and private devotions and the importance of the membership preparation sessions there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer a piece of devotional material such as the upper room may be left in each home a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults 
they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes others meet on sunday night at the midweek service or for a series of four nights some pastors have two sessions in one evening with a refreshment period between the sessions should cover four major areas a
this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday in this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life service opportunities the church school missions mens work womens work youth program social activities and finances the budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session 
 the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments the social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members in conducting the membership preparationinquirers class the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each generally held on sunday night or during the week this gives greater opportunity for the learning process 
some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly urge them to write out their questions for the box use a textbook with assigned readings each week select class members for reports on various phases of the study 
ask each member to write a statement on such topics as what christ means to me what the church means to me why join the church the duties of church members etc assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized invite class members to share in an extra period of bible study each week ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty to the reception service there is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory training including those coming by transfer of membership 
people appreciate experiences that demand something of them those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule for most of them it will be their first experience in membership training since this is a recent development in many churches those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed the preparatory class is an introductory facetoface group in which new members become acquainted with one another 
the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church this should be a high moment in their lives a nevertobeforgotten experience they should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages every detail of the service merits careful attention the hymns the sermon the ritual the right hand of fellowship the introduction to the congregation the welcome of the congregation this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation 
it can mean the difference between participation and inaction spiritual growth and decay the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church the atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience psychologically the reception should be the climax following the sermon ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and pledge cards 
provide a name card for each new member arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together invite sponsors or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service give each new member a certificate of membership introduce each new member to the congregation asking him to face the congregation 
have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests chapter # planning for the assimilation and growth of new membersthe church is the family of god 
every member of the family must have a vital place in its life yet the most difficult problem in the churchs program of evangelism is right at this point helping new members to become participating growing parts of the fellowship very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive a study of major denominational membership statistics over a twentyyear period revealed the appalling fact that nearly ## per cent of those who joined the church were lost to the church within seven years one denomination had a membership of ####### at the beginning of the period under study and twenty years later its membership stood at ####### a net growth of only ###### 
another major church body had ####### members and twenty years later its membership stood at ####### during this time ####### new members were brought into the fellowship still another denomination had ####### members twenty years ago during this period ####### members were received yet the net membership now is only ####### these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership 
studies of membership trends even in some areas where population is expanding show that numbers of churches have had little net increase though many new members were received the local family of god has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare new members can become participating growing members but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life the entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process 
those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest however it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship when they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians the church expects certain things of those who become members the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family 
care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him but with these two qualifications the statement stands the statement also points to a classic paradox the more men turn toward god who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones with a resultant fragmentation of the human race massacres attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender the words of cardinal newman come forcibly to mind oh how we hate one another for the love of god 
institutions require structure form and definition and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms to escape this fate it must rule some things out for every criterion which defines what something is at the same time proclaims implicitly if not openly what that something is not some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether 
man is at once a gregarious animal and a formcreating being having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools both eventualities are possible logically but practically they are impossible as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him 
is there any way out of the predicament the only way that i can see is through communication interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries approached creatively it is a high art it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart gods intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary 
what are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history i shall touch on three areas personal national and theological by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality structure some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all but by the need of men to have persons they can blame distrust denounce and even hate modern psychology has shown that paralleling the authoritarian personality is the bigoted personality in which insecurity inferiority suspicion and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally 
to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all for they have no redeeming features whatsoever it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they rather than pretexts for them that are causing the trouble and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial nationalism is more variable the specific instance i have in mind is the afroasian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century 
no less than twentytwo nations have already achieved independence since world war # and the number is growing by the year as an obvious consequence obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area relations between christians and nonchristians in these lands colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious for christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other actually however this turns out to be only part of the picture nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries 
insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate transpolitical justifications for their existence such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone elses all this works severely against the kind of crosscultural communication for which christian missions stand africans and asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda the people hardest hit by this suspicion are of course christians on the mainland of china for example in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion 
again india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru and his followers is gone the progressive closing of afroasian ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo i was seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists world radio program he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them after returning to the united states and raising the money he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available 
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of antichristian sentiment ironically these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since world war # while the more established denominations are barely maintaining prewar staffs although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and nonchristians in asia the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain afroasian religions themselves the partition of india has hardly improved relations between hindus and muslims 
the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state whatever its political form the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof one of our foremost jurists david dudley field has gone so far as to call this provision the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history the trend throughout the worlds religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment pakistan was created in #### expressly as a muslim state but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political situation 
the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly secular and while the nation was formerly named the islamic republic of pakistan it is now simply the republic of pakistan the new regime in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months during the years when israel was passing from crisis to crisis the sinai campaign the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties 
and in this country gustave weigels delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state the failure at that time of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to father weigels theological argument everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible in a word too human to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed 
leslie newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and his finished work but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it newbiggins qualification on the christian claim is of considerable significance the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of its priests father feeney for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church in mentioning this under salvation reconsidered i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit the termination of the human race by human action because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing they know exactly what they mean 
yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great or evil repelled sufficiently grave to warrant the destruction of mankind by mans own action i mean however that the moral theologian knows what he means by permit he is not talking in the main about probabilities risks and danger in general he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result as it efficaciously does some good he is talking about double effects of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other but causes both 
this is what in a technical sense to only permit an evil result means it means to do it and to know one is doing it but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends of course grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation or to the action of any leader or leaders which for any supposed good permits in this sense the termination of the human race by human action certainly in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative naturally where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain this has to be taken into account 
presumably if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic speculative future good by the same token not every present certain and immediate good or lesser evil that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic speculative and future evil nevertheless according to the traditional theory a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action 
he does what he can and may and must without regarding himself as lord of the future or on the other hand as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not permit in the sense explained by contrast a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities and not with the moral nature of the action to be done and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result whether by anyones doing or by accident it finds itself driven to inaction to nonpolitical action in politics and nonmilitary action in military affairs and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based mr philip toynbee writes for example that in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues if it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin 
he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically ie by considering the worst possible outcome namely the total domination of the world by russia within a few years this would be by far the better choice when it is a question of allowing the human race to survive possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish nevertheless the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified it is a possible result however improbable  the worst and least probable result  if it didnt prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing 
if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms then we need to submit ourselves to the following simple test have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are thus moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself its intention and proximate effect or the thing to be done several of the replies to mr toynbee without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil  it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation 
but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase but may be deliberately reduced by precautions against accidents or by limiting war  quoting mr kennans phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war he toynbee says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war  if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility most men will choose the latter  if philip toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war i think he is right i do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war 
let us therefore put first things first and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be mr philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of orwell in nineteen eightyfour if he believed communism was not only evil but also irredeemably evil then he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense or a static order in which no changes will take place in time to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some paxordo preserved by clothed or naked force 
not to repel injury and uphold and improve paxordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment  i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country by some deliberate act of refusal than die uselessly by atomisation would such an act of refusal be useful he does not mean in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition that if we took the risk of surrendering a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender 
this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war by creating a monopoly in one power of the worlds arsenal of unlimited weapons it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it in the past  it is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted to the very last 
the only contrary action in the future as in the past runs the risk of war and now and in the future unlike in the past any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will by human action render this planet less habitable by the human race that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to permitted effects and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated or not directly morally related to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures finally just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing by human action to accelerate this end we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankinds thrusts toward we know not what future 
for almost onesixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as selfevident by most americans few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders this pressure has urged reevaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country it is not surprising that as spokesman for real estate interests the national association of real estate boards nareb and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure 
what does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest what ought to be what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change what social ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation recently a group of the faculty at wesleyan universitys public affairs center sought some answers to these questions several new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers political scientists economists social psychologists social ethicists and theologians 
for a number of years wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy this article presents our observations of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the selfimages held by most realtors within the membership of this group as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations the most ready portrayal of oneself to the public is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner 
obviously much more than customer expectation is determining the realtors role judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers income educational level and above all racial extraction and whether these would qualify them for congenial happy relations to other people in certain community areas how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of narebs code of ethics article ## in the code adopted in #### states that a realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood though the reference to race was stricken by the association in #### being an agent of such detrimental influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid 
all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced nonwhite particularly negro peoples into allwhite restricted areas they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate professionals but agitators for some kind of cause or reform and this was no longer to be a pro obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of professional with narrow skills and specialization the effective servicing of a client rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of ones work these men for the most part educated in our best new england colleges well established financially and socially in the community under kindly but insistent probing reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a clientservice relationship this narrow professionalism does not even fit the present realities of their situation as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase 
realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work as members of social and professional organizations as citizens and civic leaders as church laymen as university alumni as newspaper readers etc from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding it seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas # the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue  # their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes and most pervasively # their interpretation of who is a real pro of what it means to be a professional man in a technical fragmented society 
the commission on race and housing concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced on the whole than any other segment of the american population but such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices also it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed like business and university groups generally these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make realtors both generally and in this group have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension 
there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the negroes desire for wellkept housing privacy etc data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically significantly no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes published by the university of california press that present the commissions findings no one anticipates any radical shift in this situation but questions concerning reading habits the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised 
relevant facts however extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of harmonious neighborhoods discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of ones democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife  # realtors realize of course that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing on the positive side recent federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position antidiscriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and while specific provisions have varied the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage 
as far as they were aware the connecticut association of real estate boards had not officially opposed the bills passage or lobbied in its support  this has not been the case everywhere in #### the real estate boards of new york city actively opposed the then pending private housing antidiscrimination law official reasoning the bill was a wanton invasion of basic property rights there are sins of omission as well as commission 
judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on shelley v kraemer #### has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry but there is little evidence that realtors or at least their associations have repudiated the principle in such clauses in the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of social reformism that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid but as yet no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into allwhite neighborhoods one of the roles of the social scientist ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work 
such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world let us say a community that embraces scarsdale or yonkers but is also infinitely richer since it is allinclusive that community of all creation is then the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment racial discrimination is wrong then not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator thus moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions  # over the years individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed 
but what significance attaches to professional beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a clients stated needs as already noted our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other as a theologian in the group pointed out a professional was before the modern period of technical specialization one who professed to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills if we look about the world today we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization science and religion science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom 
how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge and yet there is a note of hope because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material a universe that in a word is not matter but music and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith to see this vision in perspective we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom 
it was only about the size of a baseball but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of ##### tons of aj that is enough tnt to fill the tower of the empire state building and with the availability of bombs of that size war became a new problem now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world 
hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce we know that we have hydrogen in water water is af and the h stands for hydrogen there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies i have calculated that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on hiroshima 
and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond salt water is still af the same hydrogen is there and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today of course there is also an optimistic side to the picture for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days 
with just the hydrogen of our bodies we could run the world for years then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world provide adequate housing food education abundant living for everyone everywhere now let us see where this power comes from to grasp our new view of the atom we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is 
one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms and i asked myself a question suppose i had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body how large an area would they cover i calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body that is a figure one with ## ciphers quite a large number then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator 
a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at this rate so i decided to take another measure the whole state of pennsylvania imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania but instead of snowing snow it snows peas so we get the whole state covered with peas about four feet deep 
pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas but we still have a long way to go next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe north america south america europe asia and africa all covered with peas four feet deep next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas then we go out among the neighboring stars collect ### planets each the size of the earth and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep finally we go into the farthest reaches of the milky way 
so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are now although an atom is small we can still in imagination have a look at it let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow a magic alice in wonderland growing pill i start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me i shoot up through the roof into the sky past the clouds through the stratosphere out beyond the moon out among the planets until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long 
and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom according to the physics of forty years ago you would see circulating over your head down at the sides and under your feet some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs these balls are moving in great circles and ellipses and are of course the electrons the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone since these electrons are moving like planets you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom so you look down there and you see a tiny whirling point about the size of the head of a pin this is the atomic sun the atomic nucleus 
it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits it also contains nearly all the mass and the atomic energy you may ask what else there is and the answer is nothing nothing but empty space and since you are made of atoms you are nothing much but empty space too if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper 
at any rate it shows us how immaterial we are now this #### view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture for we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics and therefore the atom was really just a little machine and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts 
and since the universe is also made of atoms it is just a supermachine and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe governed by the laws of cause and effect bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists then came the scientific revolution in the late ####s a suggestion from louis de broglie a physicist in france showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves 
now as you step inside instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it these ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony harmony melody counterpoint symphonic structure are there 
and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music the island of nantucket part of the state of massachusetts lies about thirtyone miles southeast of its mother state some of the island is sand and is not suitable for living the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors during about three and a half months of the year in the summer there are three boats that run from the mainland to the island carrying passengers food and cars 
this is a fine trip too on a good day with marthas vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other it makes an excellent trip of about three hours to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect the united states of america in the nineteenth century how far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age to what extent did it mould the morals and the social economic and political life and institutions of the country 
even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of christianity from other factors although a complete picture cannot be given we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor at times we can say that it was the major factor what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation as we have seen a growing proportion although in #### still a minority were members of churches 
many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock for others the protestantism of the nineteenthcentury immigration for still others mostly of the nineteenthcentury immigration it was roman catholicism and for a small minority it was eastern orthodoxy upon all of them played the intellectual social political and economic attitudes institutions and customs of the nation upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was 
at best only an approximation could be arrived at to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd for instance we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose the temptation is to say that as the percentage of church members mounted the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed 
if guilty the offender might be excluded from membership as church membership burgeoned such measures faded into desuetude but whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation we have already hinted at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life 
throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour in the twentieth century its influence grew as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenthcentury immigration the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the older stock thus america the most widely sung of the patriotic songs was written by a new england baptist clergyman samuel francis smith ######## while a student in andover theological seminary 
the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith here was what was called the american dream namely the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of katherine lee bates ######## daughter and granddaughter of new england congregational ministers in her widely sung hymn written in #### america the beautiful with the words o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness america america god mend thy every flaw confirm thy soul in self control the liberty in law o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears 
the american dream was compounded of many strains some were clearly of christian origin among them the great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian liberty christian equality and christian fraternity the passion of the land some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection as the fountainhead of the american hope here too must be placed unitarianism and less obviously from christian inspiration emerson transcendentalism and the idealism of walt whitman we must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth among them melville hawthorne and henry james the elder all of them out of a christian background 
a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills significantly the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century came from men and women of new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian congregationalism several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism quakers some from new england had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the seventh day adventists christian science the american board of commissioners for foreign missions the american home missionary society the american bible society and new england theology 
the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others looked for the early coming of the millennium and was paralleled by the confidence in mans ability cherished by the unitarians emerson and the transcendentalists we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles and the pietism of the continent of europe among them prison reform antislavery measures legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour the inner mission and the red cross we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century 
still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age the movement to end negro slavery began before #### and mounted after that year until as a result of the civil war emancipation was achieved long before #### the christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly for example in #### the philadelphia yearly meeting of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in #### it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply in the latter year samuel hopkins from whom the hopkinsian strain of new england theology took its name asked the continental congress to abolish slavery 
beginning at least as far back as #### various baptist bodies condemned slavery after #### antislavery sentiment mounted chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock the nineteenthcentury immigration whether protestant or roman catholic was not so much concerned for very few if any among them held slaves they were mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out or were too povertystricken to own slaves benjamin lundy ######## a quaker was a pioneer in preparing the way for antislavery societies it was he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison ######## to the subject 
chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of immediate and unconditional abolition he also espoused a great variety of other causes among them womens rights prohibition and justice to the indians incurably optimistic dogmatic and utterly fearless in his youth a devout baptist in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john greenleaf whittier ######## he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible a marked impulse came to the antislavery movement through the finney revivals finney himself while opposed to slavery placed his chief emphasis on evangelism but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the antislavery campaign theodore dwight weld ######## was especially active 
as a youth he became one of finneys band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men a strong temperance advocate through the influence of a favorite teacher charles stewart another finney convert he devoted himself to the antislavery cause a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological seminary and had to leave because of their open antislavery position the majority then went to the infant oberlin they and others employed some of finneys techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause 
he shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame wendell phillips ######## from a prominent massachusetts family in his teens was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils he remained a devout christian he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition but he also stood for equal rights for women for opportunity for the freedmen and for prohibition the antislavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by arthur tappan ######## and his younger brother lewis tappan ######## 
they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer even more terrible abilities their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power thus the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors but this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities 
the royal ritual generated power into the other world it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world but naturally the royal ritual which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom this is the familiar system of cosmic government the chinese emperor by proper observance of ritual manifested divine powers 
by swaying the balance between them he effected the alternation of the seasons his power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions in this system no man is exempt from obligations failure in daily moral and ethical duties to ones family outrages to community propriety any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead and to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters 
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear the common belief was that there existed one moral order which included everything the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code 
modern westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection living in urban conditions away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatchedroof world view the individual may find it possible say to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns in china the magical system par excellence was taoism the taoists were quietist mystics who saw an unchanging unity the tao underlying all phenomena 
the taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation in other words they were actually an organization of magicians mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced into china it underwent extensive changes during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader 
the selfrealized mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic that made the world into a huge magical garden in its monastic form mahayana was merely an organization of magicpracticing monks bonzes who catered to the chinese faith in the supernatural nonmagical confucianism was a secular rational philosophy but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power 
but let us not be mistaken about confucian virtue this was not virtue as we understand the word today and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation to the confucian virtue simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones propriety was synonymous with ritual observance the mark of a true gentleman to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for mans fate 
promoters of zen to the west record its ancestry and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism but the marvelous person that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality than indian speculation he possesses magical powers and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls proponents of zen to the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism in zen probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic but in the chinese mind there was little difference between the two the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be actually zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism 
this is well evidenced by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen the idea of the inward turning of thought the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity peace and stillness a union with the infinite with the tao could be effected in fact the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the direct thinking zennist was a feature of taoism so too was the insistence on the relativity of the external world and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure indwelling spirit the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience one of its features attractive to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts 
but this is not the spirit of selfreliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistakes it it is simply that in taoist tradition as in all good mysticisms books words or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience the truth the eternal truth is not transmittable by words reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge but a positive handicap the technique of reality confusion the use of paradox and riddles to shake the minds grip on reality originated with fourth and third century bc chinese quietism the koan is not basically a new device 
in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdomwide ordering of nature popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers and this is only natural witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest wonder drug early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence but this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers the anchorite strove in fact to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power 
as the zen literature reveals as soon as an early zen master attained fame in seclusion he was called out into the world to exercise his powers the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles exponents of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of china and proposed instead a more mature less credulous view of the universe in support of this stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity hwang pah o baku one day going up mount tien tai which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats with supernatural powers met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light 
there being no bridge the master had to stop at the shore but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow him thereupon hwang pah said if i knew thou art an arhat i would have doubled you up before thou got over there the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah and praised him as a true mahayanist a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess on one occasion yang shan kyozan saw a stranger monk flying through the air 
 early this morning replied the other i set out from india  why said the teacher art thou so late  i stopped responded the man several times to look at beautiful sceneries  thou mayst have supernatural powers exclaimed yang shan yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me then the monk praised yang shan saying i have come over to china in order to worship manjucri and met unexpectedly with minor shakya and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india went back through the air 
a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes to the zen monk the universe is still populated with spiritual beings who have to be appeased part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings modern zen presentation to the west insists on the antiauthoritarian highly pragmatic nature of the zen belief scriptures are burned to make fire action is based on direct selfconfidence and so on this picture of extreme selfreliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such zendo formulas as o you demons and other spiritual beings i now offer this to you and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith 
a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading pope pius the sixth at rome in april #### wrote the following the faithful should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures for these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times the american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore urged the catholic people to read the holy bible  we hope they said that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the holy scriptures they recommended also that at a fixed hour let the entire family be assembled for night prayers followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures 
do not wonder that i said to thee you must be born again the new birth is necessary because god is holy but as the one who called you is holy be you also holy in all your behavior for it is written you shall be holy because i am holy holiness without which no man will see god 
as it is written there is not one just man all have sinned and have need of the glory of god the new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned you also when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins 
in their case the god of this world satan has blinded their unbelieving minds that they should not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god # corinthians # # # for his workmanship we are created in christ jesus the new birth is effected through the word of godfor you have been reborn not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible through the word of god 
amen amen i say to thee unless a man be born again of water symbol of the word of god see ephesians ## and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit if we are born of god we have faith in christ as the only saviour everyone who believes that jesus is the christ is born of god 
if we are born of god we do not practice sin as a habit whoever is born of god does not commit sin that is he does not practice sin cf # st john # # we know that no one who is born of god commits sin  the new nature received at the time of regeneration is divine and holy and as the believer lives under the power of this new nature he does not practice sin 
if you know that he god is just righteous know that everyone also who does what is just righteous has been born of him if we are born of god we love god everyone who loves is born of god and knows god if we are born of god we love the brethren we know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren 
if we are born of god we overcome the world all that is born of god overcomes the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world our faith if we are born of god we grow in not into but in grace but grow in grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ 
i am convinced of this that he who has begun a good work in you will bring it to perfection until the day of christ jesus now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in gladness to the only god our savior through jesus christ our lord belong glory and majesty dominion and authority before all time and now and forever the new birth is necessary because the spiritual kingdom requires a spiritual nature jesus answered and said to him nicodemus amen amen i say to thee unless a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god  amen amen i say to thee unless a man be born again of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god 
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit do not wonder that i said to thee you must be born again for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account if then any man is in christ he is a new creature literally he is a new creation the former things have passed away for by grace you have been saved through faith 
not as the outcome of works lest anyone may boast for his workmanship we are created in christ jesus the new birth is the implantation of a new life he who has the son has the life he who has not the son has not the life 
the new birth is the impartation of the divine nature through which he has granted us the very great and precious promises so that through them you may become partaker of the divine nature the new birth is christ living in you by faith christ in you your hope of glory it is now no longer i that live but christ lives in me 
to have christ dwelling through faith in your hearts the wind blows where it will and thou hearest its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes so is everyone who is born of the spirit amen amen i say to you he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has life everlasting and does not come to judgment but has passed from death to life the new birth is a work of god 
to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god you may be very religious a good church member an upright honest and sincere person you may be baptized confirmed reverent and worshipful you may attend mass do penance say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment 
our blessed lord jesus christ the sinless son of god who could not lie said amen amen i say to thee unless a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god st john # #  you must be born again st john # # being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting christ as saviour and being convicted by the holy spirit of my lost condition i do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works and just now receive jesus as my personal saviour and salvation as a free gift from him you may do as you please with god now god placed himself in mens hands when he sent jesus christ into the world as perfect god and perfect man in one being 
you can do likewise though christ is not bodily present you can ignore his book the bible and his church you can laugh at his bloodbought salvation curse his followers and laugh at hell the eternal christ may knock at your souls door calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven you may refuse him spit on him call him a devil curse him 
on the other hand you may seek his favor humble yourself before him and beg his mercy implore his forgiveness forsake your sins and abandon your whole life to him he has said behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me revelation ### the latch is on your side of the door the choice is yours the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with god the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of holy spirit discipline 
god has already set the day when you will be in his hands what he does with you then depends on what you do with him now then it will be a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god if you have abused him in your hands this issue that you are reading marks my ##th anniversary when i came into being ## years ago i had one primary purpose to help men and women everywhere to know god better and through knowing him better to become happier and more effective people 
some of the people who speak through my pages are famous some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope some are so filled with gratitude for the gift of life and the love of god that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known and will never see fifteen years ago there were no guideposts at all this month a million guideposts will circulate all over the world 
they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following to me the explanation is very simple i am not doing anything of myself it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness even when they turn away from it it is the power that holds the stars in their orbits but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass 
it is mankinds wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace all things are possible to god but he chooses usually to work through people sometimes such people sense that they are being used fifteen years ago troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the postwar world a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women regardless of creed or color could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living neither had any publishing experience but they had faith in their idea 
compared to the big established magazines my first efforts seemed feeble indeed but from the start they had two important ingredients sincerity and realism the people who told the stories were sincere for example early in my life when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of new yorks downandouters he didnt just ask questions len lesourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days 
the help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere the crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me that was when a remarkable woman teresa durlach came to my aid not so much with money as with wisdom and courage  youre not living up to your own principles she told my discouraged people  youre so preoccupied that youve let your faith grow dim 
visualize them then believe you are getting them and you will have them and now a million january guideposts are in circulation with our growth came expansion into new fields of service today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees they say all personnel have spiritual needs which guideposts helps to meet 
they say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the armed forces to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere bedridden people say i am easy to hold and read three years ago it became possible to finance a braille edition for blind readers throughout these exciting years i have been fortunate for although i have never offered great financial inducements talent has found its way to me william boal who so ably organizes business operations 
searching for the best in spiritual stories my roving editors cover not only the country but the whole world glenn kittler has been twice to africa once spending a week with dr albert schweitzer last summer john and elizabeth sherrill were in alaska twice a month the editorial staff meets in new york for an early supper then a long evening of ideaexchange around the table sit protestant catholic and jew 
sidney fields years of experience as a new york columnist catherine marshall lesourd the insight that has made her books worldfamous and norm mullendore the keen perception of an advertising executive there are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence elaine st johns may fly in from the west coast for the editorial staff meetings starr jones gets up every morning at five oclock milks his family cow attends to farm chores and then takes a twohour train trip to new york 
we have also seen the power of faith at work among us rose weiss who handles all the prayerrequests that we receive answering each letter personally has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering she has had many major operations and now gets about in a limited way on braces and crutches recently john sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer we prayed for john during surgery we asked others to pray all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him 
but you see those who are not mentioned will not resent it that is the kind of people they are perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs a little sanctimonious serious yes but also much laughter sharp division of opinion too and strenuous debate 
and there is also something intangible that hovers around the table each meeting starts with a prayer offered spontaneously by one member of the group it takes many forms this prayer but in essence it is always a request for guidance for open minds and gentle hearts for honesty and sincerity for the wisdom and the insights that will help guideposts readers for you readers are an allimportant part of the spiritual experiment that is guideposts i need your support your criticism your encouragement your prayers 
havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of mens eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices rumors flew from lip to lip that fidel castro was on his way to havana coming from the mountains where he had fought batista for five years already the city was filled with barbudos the bearded wardirty revolutionaries carrying carbines waving to the crowds that lined the prado and then castro himself did come bearded smiling yet if you looked closely youd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips 
i am sure that castro was happy too about that support diario de la marina was the oldest and most influential paper in cuba with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny my grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials my own earliest memories are of exiles my three brothers and i were taken often to the united states to visit relatives while my father stayed on to fight the dictator machado when it was my turn i too printed the truth as i knew it about batista and rejoiced to see his regime topple 
i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana within a week however i began to suspect that something was wrong for castro was bringing cuba not freedom but hatred he spent long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge he showed us how he dealt with his enemies he executed them before tv cameras 
he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance new schools were rising but with this went a harsh proclamation any academic degree earned during batistas regime was invalid he had promised cheaper housing arbitrarily he cut all rents in half whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room under another law hundreds of farms were seized farm workers had their wages cut almost in half 
a suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist in my mind i began to review his use of hate to gain support his division of society into two classes one the hero the other the villain but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the palace what should i do about it i asked myself 
there was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him mobs would appear outside our windows shouting paredon i was proud of the new buildings which housed diario now the rotogravures gleaming behind glass doors the thump and whir of our new presses here was a powerful readymade medium but it could speak only if i told it to then one day early in january #### i sat down at my desk and suddenly i was aware of the crucifix

third we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the countrys objectives and resources this includes assistance in assembling the basic economic financial technological and educational information on which programing depends surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy such as transport agriculture communication industry and power designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established 
it must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions to insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth in the more primitive areas where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available thus we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs in such a case however we would encourage the recipient country to get on with its programing task supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the countrys development was conditional upon programing progress being made 
a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of selfhelp it is vitally important that the new us aid program should encourage all of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves external aid can only be marginal although the margin as in the case of the marshall plan can be decisive external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to selfhelp us aid therefore should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take 
open societies can take many forms and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals on the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a countrys development potential we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur the major areas of selfhelp are the following a the effective mobilizing of resources this includes not only development programing but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment 
and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few  b the reduction of dependence on external sources this includes foreseeing balanceofpayments crises with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports it also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed  c tapping the energies of the entire population 
otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability in many societies what we regard as corruption favoritism and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources if dishonesty corruption and favoritism are widespread moreover tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates antiamerican sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest some of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification correct or not of communist regimes with personal honesty and prowestern regimes with corruption 
the united states can use its aid as an incentive to selfhelp by responding with aid on a sustained basis tailored to priority needs to those countries making serious efforts in selfhelp in many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts there are other countries where with skillful diplomacy we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth but there will be still other countries where despite the inadequacy of the level of selfhelp we shall deem it wise for political or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance even in these cases we should promote selfhelp by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination 
to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion most of our aid will go to those nearing selfsufficiencyhow long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country in several significant cases such as india a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no governmenttogovernment assistance these cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance 
the number of countries thus favorably situated is small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world meantime over the decade of the sixties we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into selfsustaining growth in still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible the whole program must be conceived of as an effort stretching over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world it must be recognized as a slowacting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in laos and cuba 
 a the need to budget a period of years many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods dams river development schemes transportation networks educational systems require years to construct moreover on complex projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence thus as a development program is being launched commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year 
 b the need to plan investment programs more importantly several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least # years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence without such forward planning investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed  c the need to allocate country resources 
they must be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory policies they must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary selfhelp measures which are described in the preceding section the taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions moreover once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves felt they must therefore be related to longrange development plans 
in this as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones the extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources to set targets toward which they should be working to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves all on a realistic longterm basis will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them if they feel that we are taking a longterm view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably longterm association with them in their development activities they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with longterm commitments you have heard him tell these young people that during his almost ## years of service in the congress he has seen the kaisers and the hitlers and the mussolinis the tojos and stalins and khrushchevs come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest nation that mankind has ever known 
so i say mr speaker god bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the united states of america and the free world you remember the words of president kennedy a week or so ago when someone asked him when he was in canada and dean rusk was in europe and vice president johnson was in asia who is running the store and he said the same fellow who has been running it sam rayburn mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record and also that they may have # legislative days in which to extend their remarks 
remarks of hon joseph p addabbo of new yorkit is notably significant that so many members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved speaker the honorable sam rayburn i purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the state of texas i did so because i agree with so many here today that he is the beloved speaker of all the people of the united states for the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative branch of our government it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country 
many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me and like many of you here present i hold as the highlight of all the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable speaker of the house at that time he afforded me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as i may need to speak about my background my hopes my views on various national and local topics and any problems that i may have been vexed with at the time he was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel in conclusion he wished me well and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself he asked to be remembered to my wife and children 
he is most effective in the ordinary business of the house and in the legislative accomplishments of this session he easily rose to great occasion even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle and as the nation witnessed these contests he rose even as admitted by those who differed with him to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan i am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant he will ever be my example as a true statesman one who is thoroughly human who affects no dignity and who is endowed with real ability genuine worth and sterling honesty all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long may the divine speaker in heaven bless this country with sam rayburns continued service here for years to come 
in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the stabilizing force that he represents in current american government is an almost indispensable source of strength he has become in this half century the grand old man of american history it seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to providence that sam rayburns vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades here briefly in this humble tribute i have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country but the task is beyond me because i hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions sam rayburn has made as an individual as a legislator as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this nation 
what sam rayburns life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of ones own community ones own district ones own state and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time for sam rayburn never forgot bonham his home community and he never forgot texas in the same way i like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community our district our state and if we follow the rayburn pattern as consciously or by an instinctual political sense i like to think i have followed it then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country for what sam rayburns life in this house teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district 
this may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson sam rayburns career up to this hour teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government more than that sam rayburn is the very living symbol of an ironclad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition through the most rancorous battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility sam rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions it is an answer in its way individual and highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics 
it is i insist hard to define the rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes so deep but this we know here is a great life that in every area of american politics gives the american people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor decency and selfrespect i pray to god that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the united states and the whole world can ill afford to lose all but two of my nine terms in the house of representatives has been served under the speakership of sam rayburn i have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carries his greatness 
he will be considered not only great among his contemporaries but as great among all the americans who have played a part in the countrys history since the beginning i pay my personal tribute to sam rayburn stalwart texan and great american not only because today he establishes a record of having served as speaker of the house of representatives more than twice as long as henry clay but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half century of service as a member of congress speaker rayburn has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the house in the speakers chair he had an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the house in #### the ##d congress no one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has sam rayburn 
but to run the gauntlet of the programs sam rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of todays record no greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this house than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great speaker this great legislator this great texan this great american my sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today sam rayburn is one of the greatest american public figures in the history of our country and i consider that i have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing sam rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a member of the house of representatives in the congress of the united states others may speak of speaker rayburns uniquely long and devoted service 
i prefer to speak however of sam rayburn the person rather than sam rayburn the american institution although sam rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition no one could be more devoted than he to the american congress as an institution and more aware of its historical significance in the political history of the world and i shall never forget his moving talks delivered in simple yet eloquent words upon the meaning of our jobs as representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of todays assault upon popular government above all he is a person to whom a fledgling representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new congressman in this role of father confessor he has always been most characteristic and most helpful 
the practice of stateowned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years at least one state vehicle was in existence in #### the state presently owns ### passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately ### in #### the automobile maintenance unit or motor pool came into existence in #### and has been responsible for centralized maintenance and management of stateowned transportation since that time the motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems records keeping analyses of vehicle use and effecting economies in vehicle operation 
purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes the legislatures role in policy determination concerning stateowned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to appropriating funds for vehicles the meaningful policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the states administrative officers meaningful policies include a kinds of cars the state should own b when cars should be traded c the need and assignment of vehicles d use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances e employees taking cars home and f need for liability insurance on state automobiles 
the state purchases and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle the purchase of compact economy cars is being made currently on a test basis cars are traded mostly on a threeyear basis in the interest of economy the factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles 
the state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars a survey of practices and/or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with rhode islands practices fortyseven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business two other states provide vehicles but only with legislative approval states which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency the individual or to a central pool 
nineteen states report laws policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances of these states the average changeover point at which a car is substituted for allowances is ##### miles per year mileage allowances for state employees are of two types a actual mileage and b fixed monthly allowances actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personallyowned vehicles on state business at the rate of $## per mile fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a nonitemized basis 
rhode islands reimburseable rate of $## per mile for use of personallyowned cars compares favorably with other states rates the average of states rates is $### per mile rhode islands rate of $## per mile is considerably lower than reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a $## per mile average actual mileage allowances are welladministered and not unduly expensive for the state the travel regulations requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive 
however they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures flat payments over $## per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of stateowned vehicles travel allowances including subsistence have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other states allowances with few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and $## per day subsistence travel allowances are wellregulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control 
few records are available concerning the subject prior to #### the registry of motor vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as #### it should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old the best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the ####s and ##s at that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties 
once the principle was established the increase in stateowned vehicles came rapidly and reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth table # immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees this rate of increase does not signify anything in itself it does not indicate loose management ineffective controls or poor policy 
in the past twenty years the ratio of stateowned automobiles per state employees has varied from # to ## then to # to ## now whether there were too few automobiles in #### or too many now is problematical the fact is simply that stateowned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them while the origin of stateowned automobiles may be obscured subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly prior to #### automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned 
in #### however the nation was at war the state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual it met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit more popularly called the motor pool a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation the motor pool then as now had headquarter facilities in providence and other garages located throughout the state it was organizationally the responsibility of the department of public works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pools operation 
the management of stateowned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made the agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the costbilling system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis one indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period ######## while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased ##% the total maintenance cost increased only ##% 
the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles  note so far as state police cars are concerned only their replacement is under this division this tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade stateowned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs in light of depreciation become excessive moreover it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet for example if one driver puts on ##### miles per year and another driver #### miles per year their cars will be switched so that both cars will have ##### miles after two years rather than ##### miles and related higher maintenance costs and ##### miles respectively 
it handles all types of vehicle maintenance but concentrates more on service station activities than on extensive vehicle repairs it contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and costdata studies and analyses pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be traded for sound economies from this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data 
based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of ##### miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personallyowned vehicles they estimate further that with sufficient experience and when costdata of compact cars is compiled the breakeven point may be reduced to #### miles of travel per year table # shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities present pool quarters at two locations in providence are crowded antiquated and in general make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment 
the purchase of stateowned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made bids are evaluated by the division of purchases with the assistance of pool staff and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public the reasons are obvious # the state is buying in quantity and # it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay 
in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier this is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately costaccounting principles the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles the legislatures role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles 
there was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years at the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well thus there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and in addition must give assistance to its local governments 
consequently there have developed several forms of grantsinaid and shared taxes as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level notwithstanding state aid the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax this is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored taxation of tangible movable property in rhode island has been generally of a hands off nature due possibly to several reasons # local assessors in the main are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs # the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult and # the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property among the many problems in the taxing of personal property and of movable tangible property in particular two are significant # situs # fair and equitable assessment of value 
although the laws of the various states in general specify the situs of property ie residence or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exceptions regarding boats airplanes mobile homes etc seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment rhode island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated it also provides for the taxation of all personal property belonging to inhabitants of the state both tangible and intangible and the tangible personal property of nonresidents in this state in defining personal property it specifically mentions all ships or vessels at home or abroad intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year 
this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on december ## both boats and aircraft would fall within this category as well as motor vehicles the location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged obviously it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the ##st day of december in view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft 
this situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably justifiably middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that all rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ## months next preceding the first day of april in each year the smithfield tax assessor in turn claims the tax under the provision of law and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated this problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors who in general are nonprofessional and parttime personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem this accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in rhode island 
the rhode island public expenditure council in its publication once commented the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the state take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property an adequately staffed and equipped state assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the state a single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of ## different and independent assessing units the institute of public administration in its report to the state fiscal study commission in #### recommended consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job 
to determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in rhode island the replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case there are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town these opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time in reply to a question of whether they now tax boats airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not 
one assessor checked boats only another trailers and tractors one mentioned house trailers and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type in two cases airplanes only were indicated it is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation but the conclusion may be drawn that ## towns do not assess movable personal property and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats it would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property 
only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership fifteen stated that it was according to location four by residence of the owner and nineteen did not answer twentyseven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property and only five were opposed on this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now 
another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides of those who have an opinion it seems that assessment by location is preferred there was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date to summarize it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge 
interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats assessors in rhode island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting it has been obvious to the assessors particularly those in shore communities that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach through their professional organization the rhode island tax officials association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed no satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors 
it is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation it is known that at least five towns barrington bristol narragansett newport and westerly place some value on some boats for tax purposes however few are taxed and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations no one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be slightly more than #### boats were registered with the coast guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law 
the assessors association meeting at narragansett in september #### devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem local industrys investment in rhode island was the big story in ####s industrial development effort fiftytwo companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction totaling ####### square feet and representing an investment of $######## with minor exceptions this expansion was instituted either by firms based in rhode island or outofstate manufacturers already operating here what made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although #### was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation rhode island scored marked progress in new industry new plants and new jobs 
leading firms that arranged their own financing included speidel corporation cornelldubilier photek inc division of textron narragansett gray iron foundry w r cobb company and mays manufacturing company expansion and relocation of industry in rhode island is the direct responsibility of the development councils industrial division and the figures quoted above indicate a successful years operation industrial division personnel worked with ## outofstate and ## rhode island concerns during #### many of whom are still interested in a rhode island location they are conscious of this states new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in rhode island although much of the industrial divisions promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries small business is also afforded considerable attention 
a primary function is the operation of a government bid center which receives bids daily from the federal governments principal purchasing agencies assistance is rendered to interested rhode island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations where to obtain specifications and followups concerning qualification during the past year ##### government bid invitations were received and #### procurement leads were mailed to rhode island manufacturers in addition the offices domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses how and where to apply for financial assistance 
the office of foreign and domestic commerce is also active in the field of international trade assisting rhode island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad this office cooperates with the u s department of commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include statistics on markets abroad locating foreign agents buyers distributors etc information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations licensing investments and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment during the year #### this office supplied ### visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce and made ## field visits 
we also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of rhode island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here to reach a still greater audience of locationminded manufacturers our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from $##### to $##### and the industrial building authoritys financial participation was upped from $##### to $##### newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the new york times and the wall street journal eastern and midwestern editions which averaged two prominent ads per month and to a lesser degree the new york herald tribune and for the west coast the los angeles times and the wall street journal pacific coast edition in addition to the regular schedule advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the new york times boston herald american banker electronic news and for local promotion the providence sunday journal magazine advertising included management methods the new englander u s investor and plant location 
the #### advertising campaign brought a total of ### inquiries ### from media and ## from direct mail two hundred and nineteen were received from ## of our ## united states and ## came from foreign countries new york led in the number of inquiries followed by california new jersey massachusetts and pennsylvania among foreign countries responding were germany canada brazil and india

its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the united states declining balance of trade for #### and #### approximately ### representatives of business attended this conclave and the r i export conference committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event on october #th of last year the industrial division sponsored the governors conference on industrial development at the former henry barnard school a comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted ### interested individuals morning sessions included addresses by ward miller jr of the u s dept of commerce 
workshop sessions in the afternoon featured development executives from pennsylvania connecticut and maine and rounded out a rewarding program in connection with this conference a ##page supplement was published in the october #nd edition of the providence sunday journal devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in rhode island it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this division more than #### copies have been sent out to prospective clients other special mailings by the industrial division included copies of speeches delivered at the governors conference letters and brochures to conferees at medchemical symposium at university of rhode island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as society of industrial realtors 
the industrial division published in #### a new attractive industrial brochure rhode island right for industry and prepared copy for a new edition of the directory of manufacturers to be printed shortly and for a new space catalogue additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for operation turnkey the new automated post office and a conference with representatives of brown university providence college and university of rhode island and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel stated in its simplest terms the main job of the planning division is to plan for the future of the state of rhode island the activities of the planning division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the development council which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning two years ago the institute of public administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled statelocal relations in metropolitan rhode island 
these objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the planning division first priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state recognizing the truth of the statement by the institute of public administration that metropolian planning in rhode island means or should mean state planning the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of rhode islands problems it will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government to this end the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available on a shared cost basis technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff 
among the operating departments of the state between the cities and towns of the state and on a regional basis between the six new england states on the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources plans for the provision of essential services such as water will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries within the framework of the state plan the state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan 
functionally the planning division carries out four activities longrange state planning current state planning local planning assistance and the preparation of the state development budget the planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation the longrange aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases basic mapping inventory analysis and plan and policy formation the work program as it was originally proposed was to take five years to complete 
the basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion july # #### since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program the first step taken by the planning division to implement the longrange state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps one at a scale of # inch to a mile and the second a series of ## sheets at a scale of # inch to #### feet covering the entire state with these maps completed the inventory phase of the plan has been started with the aid of matching federal funds available under section ### of the housing act of #### as amended the planning division began a one year program july # #### to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program this phase consists of four items urban land use rural land use physical features and public utility service areas 
the urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning the rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the university of rhode island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use the mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and like the other two inventory projects are scheduled for completion july # #### the collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose it is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in rhode island 
there are fortyseven special district governments in rhode island excluding two regional school districts four housing authorities and the kent county water authority these fortyseven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes to borrow money own property sue and be sued and in general to exercise normal corporate powers unlike cities and towns however they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state bureau of audits it is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government in addition to the collection of service charges the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $###### 
fortysix states including rhode island end their fiscal year on june ## the other four states end on varying dates alabama sept ## new york march ## pennsylvania may ## and texas august ## in sixteen states the fiscal year ending of the cities june ## is the same as that of the state alaska arizona california delaware massachusetts montana nevada new mexico north carolina north dakota oklahoma oregon vermont west virginia wyoming and hawaii in eleven states the fiscal year of the cities ends on december ## while the state fiscal year ends on june ## arkansas colorado indiana kansas new hampshire new jersey ohio south dakota utah washington and wisconsin in eight states whose fiscal years close on june ## a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on december ## 
one state alabama closes its fiscal year on september ## and all cities in the state with one exception also close fiscal years on september ## mississippi closes its fiscal year on june ## while all of its cities close their fiscal years on september ## pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on may ## all of its cities close their fiscal years on december ## the remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state city and local governments 
an excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently he listed among the values of fiscal uniformity # the uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spending the uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn it enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts 
by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set on expenditures the uniform fiscal year brings the towns fiscal year into line with that of the schools which expend the largest share of local disbursements this greatly simplifies the towns bookkeeping and financial reporting the uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes furthermore tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in shortterm treasury notes augmenting the towns miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy 
when towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons and as the cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also increases towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare of all advantages probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times 
in any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs heavy when shortterm money rates are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most this type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year 
both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below it has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization and the statelocal sharing of responsibility for certain important functions this is no longer true the haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient statelocal revenue and expenditure relationships although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in rhode island there are also certain difficulties encountered 
one problem is a matter of shifting dates the other is how to finance the transition little can be done about the changing of dates this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars it usually means a confused and disgruntled taxpaying public for a period of time 
the other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns it should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city fortunately there are no cities or towns in the state with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change sacrifice will have to be made in some cases but it is to the municipalitys advantage to finance the changeover for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for rhode island municipalities to exert effort to secure them 
first the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula second the shift to a uniform july # to june ## fiscal year will of itself improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns there are at least two problems to consider one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary the latter matter is considered in detail in a later section 
plans vary from the talking stage to establishing special committees to accomplish this end what is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them an analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought however it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved the adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout rhode island based on a july # to june ## year are shown below 
these municipalities include barrington lincoln middletown newport north kingstown and south kingstown one town and one city coventry and east providence require an adjustment of their fiscal year only this change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year six cities and towns are now on a july # to june ## fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity these cities and towns include bristol glocester pawtucket cumberland central falls and woonsocket 
both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars however neither of these two cities is on the desired july # to june ## fiscal year the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them in that both cities end their fiscal years on september ## they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months commencing with september ## and ending with june ## these three installment dates would be october ## january ## and april ## providence and november ## february ## and may ## cranston 
their tax collection calendar could then be july ## october ## january ## and april ## providence and august ## november ## february ## and may ## cranston under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods the remaining twentythree towns have fiscal years which end prior to june ## all of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years 
aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary it should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements in many communities there is simply no financial problem it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques in other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes 
as shown earlier in table # the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars in addition no two rhode island communities are identical in relation to their overall financial condition these factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars the financial condition of the treasuries and the length of the transition interval suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from shortterm serial notes to longterm bonds 
for those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the problem rhode island heritage week proclamation by john a notte jr governorthe theme of rhode island heritage week for #### will be independence and union it commemorates the ###th anniversary of rhode islands independence when upon may # #### the general assembly by its action established the first free republic in the new world as this year marks the centennial of the beginning of the civil war this fact is being commemorated with several exhibits throughout the state but most of all paying tribute to the first rhode island volunteers who rushed to the defense of the city of washington putting at the disposal of president lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time

as another thanksgiving draws near let us take time out from the often hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that filled the hearts of the pilgrims on the first thanksgiving the pilgrims gathered to thank the lord for his benevolence during their first year in the new land they had been through trying times but their faith in the almighty had given them the courage and the strength to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were the price they had to pay for freedom and as the pilgrims bowed their heads in humble gratitude they shared another feeling the anticipation of what the future held for them and their posterity they could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would some day be born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of hope to the oppressed countries of the world 
we who are living today may learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrated the first thanksgiving day the lord has shown time and time again his love for us we have only to compare the liberty and high standard of living we enjoy in this great country with the oppression and frugality of other nations to realize with humble gratitude that gods providence has been with us since the very beginning of our country and yet accompanying our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial time with world peace constantly being threatened most of us regard the future skeptically and even with fear 
now therefore do i john a notte jr governor of the state of rhode island and providence plantations proclaim thursday november ##rd #### as thanksgiving day and so let us remember on this day not only to thank the almighty who gave hope and courage to the pilgrims but also to place our trust in him that he will continue to protect us in the future as he has in the past in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the state to be affixed this ##st day of november in the year of our lord one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone and of independence the one hundred and eightysixth be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the act of july # #### ## stat ### as amended ## usc ######## is further amended to read as follows section # in view of the increasing shortage of usable surface and ground water in many parts of the nation and the importance of finding new sources of supply to meet its present and future water needs it is the policy of the congress to provide for the development of practicable lowcost means for the largescale production of water of a quality suitable for municipal industrial agricultural and other beneficial consumptive uses from saline water and for studies and research related thereto

the institute is engaged in an extensive program of medicomilitary scientific research in both morphological and experimental pathology among the specific areas of concentration in which the staff is engaged are such projects as biological and biochemical studies of the effects of microwaves study of motor end plates in man and animals investigation of respiratory diseases of laboratory animals there has been an increase in cooperative research with other federal agencies and civilian institutions 
also the defense atomic support agency sponsored a longrange study at this institute on the response of massive suspension cultures of mammalian cells to acute radiation other scientific agencies both federal and civilian supported studies in quantitative electron microscopical approach to microchemistry and microcytochemistry the investigation of the relationship of diphosphopyridine nucleotide synthesizine enzyme to tumor growth morphological study and classification of leukemia and lymphoma cases in animals and the study of structural changes in m leprae and other mycobacteria 
in addition to maintaining a permanent central file of illustrations of diseases wounds and injuries of military importance it provides facilities for clinical photography photomicrography and medical arts and operates a printing plant by permission of congressional committee for publication of an atlas of tumor pathology it also maintains shops for the design and fabrication of exhibits training aids and instruments and libraries for the loan of films and teaching lantern slide sets during this period a total of ### exhibits were presented at ### medical and scientific meetings of these exhibits ### were newly constructed visual and operable training aids developed by the medical illustration service were used in support of army medical service mass casualty exercises 
demonstrations of new and projected training aids were conducted at the medical service instructors conference brooke army medical center texas in support of the emphasis placed by the department of defense on instruction in emergency medical care the medical illustration service developed casualty simulation kits and rescue breathing manikins which are being field tested and overhead projector transparency sets on the subjects of military sanitation first aid for soldiers the emergency medical treatment unit phase # and emergency war surgery in support of the north atlantic treaty organization nato handbook 
the british and canadian liaison officers as well as office of civil and defense mobilization the american red cross and similar interested organizations were informed from time to time as training aids were developed nine veterinary lantern slide teaching sets were developed and distributed and lantern slide teaching sets on ## pathology subjects were added to the loan library of the medical illustration service illustrations were prepared for ## department of the army manuals and one graphic training aid sixteen lantern slide sets were loaned to the government of india and eight sets were forwarded to the us embassy managua nicaragua for the educational exchange program the senate subcommittee on reorganization and international organizations was provided samples of visual aids on first aid and personal health produced by the medical illustration service 
this consists of ## individual registries two of which were added during fiscal years ######## the registry of forensic pathology and the testicular tumor registry these registries are sponsored by ## national medical dental and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of followup of living patients the natural history of various diseases of militarymedical importance the american registry of pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the armed forces institute of pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international basis under such conditions as may be agreed upon between the national research council and the surgeons general of the army navy and air force the staff utilized the collected material in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international meetings exhibits and published studies during the period of this report ##### new cases were entered into the various registries 
in this same period six new fascicles of the atlas of tumor pathology were published and distributed to medical centers worldwide there were ##### copies of fascicles sold and ### copies distributed free during this period fortyfive new clinicopathologic conferences were prepared bringing the total to ## available for loan distribution nine new teaching clinicopathologic conference sets were prepared which makes a total of ## types of teaching sets for loan during this period #### teaching sets were distributed on loan 
the demand for teaching sets continues unabated since they provide the means for the military physicians to review the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes in fiscal year #### the medical museum was moved to chase hall a temporary building on independence avenue at ninth street southwest and continued to display to the public the achievements of the armed forces medical services during the period of this report ## panel exhibits depicting the latest developments in medical research were displayed of the ### exhibits of all types shown ### were new or refurbished of the ### specimens newly mounted or refurbished ### were prepared for other agencies 
a threedimensional exhibit depicting a century of naval medicine was formally presented to the director by george s squibb greatgrandson of the founder of e r squibb and sons for permanent display in the museum space was provided for shorttime guest medical exhibits and the museum collected new accessions of microscopes medical surgical and diagnostic instruments uniform and similar items of historical medicomilitary significance during the period the laboratory rendered centralized macropathological service to qualified requesters specimens were mounted for military installations governmental agencies and medical schools three hundred five copies of the manual of macropathological techniques were distributed 
during fiscal years #### and #### there were ###### visitors to the museum during the period from # july #### through ## january #### the medical museum was required to move to temporary building s on the mall from chase hall throughout the period and during the movement operation the museum continued its functional support of the armed forces institute of pathology the armed forces medical publication agency established in #### has published since january #### the united states armed forces medical journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to medical department officers of the three military services its supplement the medical technicians bulletin supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel 
in addition their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated air force medical bulletin estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the journal and bulletin on a triservice basis as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service were between $##### and $##### additionally on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations the availability of the journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage from # july #### to ## june #### ## numbers of the journal and nine of the bulletin were published each journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest and departments devoted to military medical news reviews of new books and other features of interest to officers of the medical services 
beginning with the october #### issue of the journal the method of production of copy for photooffset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting this resulted in an improved appearance but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds the use of ### instead of ### substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the may #### issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly $#### in unexpended funds two special issues were published one for november #### on space medicine the other the tenth anniversary issue for january #### the february #### issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled the medical officer writes 
occasional features were published on historical medicine special reports bibliography and collectors items in may #### the armed forces institute of pathology began a series of articles on the medical museum and in june the institute started contributing a regular monthly case for diagnosis the institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles beginning in the fall of #### on its more significant scientific exhibits the armed forces epidemiological board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its ## commissions so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the armed forces the first report in this continuing series appeared in the september #### issue of the journal 
this work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method and raises this property to ## percent above that accepted a few years ago similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride the development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion in one of these an explodingwire device to study systems thermodynamically up to #### af and ### atmospheres pressure a major goal was achieved the accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than # percent 
the method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter the element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy this is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element a highspeed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion the shutter consists of two parts a fastopening part and a fastclosing part 
the fastopening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil approximately af placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera the opening action is obtained when a capacitor charged to high voltage is suddenly discharged through the foil during the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line thus allowing light to pass into the camera experiments have shown that the shutter is ## percent open in about #### microseconds the shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil 
the detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and perhaps planetary atmospheres among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides oh and ch somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides sh sih and aj very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable in interstellar gas concentrations as low as af molecules per af may be sufficient as compared to the af hydrogen atoms af required for detection of the ##cm line 
therefore only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible to secure precise measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead this involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor which shifts the lowfrequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity the first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the oh radical 
the frequencies are ###### and ###### af with an uncertainty of ### af success in observing these spectral lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory preparations are being made for similar experiments on ch and sh radicals the bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range ## to ## af the efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors and helium# vaporpressure measurements see p ### 
such an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer when values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium# vapor pressures differences of about ## and # millidegrees respectively were found this result is preliminary and work is continuing carbon resistors and impuritydoped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from ### to ## af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within #/# millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium 
the estimated standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were # millidegree and for the third resistor ## millidegrees the reproducibilities of helium vaporpressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath from ## to ## af surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in ## and ##liter metallic storage dewars the gradient was about one half of a millidegree at ## af but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point 
however the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vaporpressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb from the liquid helium surface it has also been observed in helium # that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer this has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow precise pressurevolumetemperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer 
the transducer is a nulltype instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm #### in thick and # in in diameter a small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced #### in apart for af spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit over a temperature range from ## to ### af and at pressures up to ### atm an overload of ### psi applied for a period of one day results in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter of mercury a #year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed 
a significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present the results of the study based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity thermal conductivity thermal diffusion and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of #### to ##### af and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from af to af times normal density in march #### representatives of the national laboratories of australia canada the netherlands united kingdom ussr united states and west germany met at the nbs to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between ## and ## af as a first step toward this goal arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory 
these thermometers have now been sent to the united kingdom for calibration at the national physical laboratory during the last week of march #### columbus ohio was the site of the fourth symposium on temperature its measurement and control in science and industry the symposium which was jointly sponsored by the american institute of physics the instrument society of america and the national bureau of standards attracted nearly one thousand registrants including many from abroad the bureau contributed to the planning and success of the symposium through the efforts of mr w a wildhack general chairman and dr c m herzfeld program chairman dr a v astin nbs director opened the #day session with introductory remarks following which a total of twentysix papers were given throughout the week by nbs scientists from both the washington and boulder laboratories 
the programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared the application of infrared techniques to solid state studies and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation two data centers have been established for the collection indexing critical evaluation and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross sections under the sponsorship of the office of naval research and the advanced research projects agency a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities an exhaustive survey was made of the literature and a primary reference file of approximately ### references was catalogued selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation 
this apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements a study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about af percent a set of tables containing spectral intensities for ##### lines of ## elements as observed in a copper matrix in a dc arc was completed and published studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities these data are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas

there is hereby authorized to be appropriated out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated such sums as may be necessary to enable the commission to carry out its functions under this title mr speaker for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have the causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex high taxes losses of revenue to government subsidized highway and air carriers to name but two and the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied ranging all the way from government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service there have been a number of sound plans proposed 
though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since world war # total annual rail commutation dropped ### million for #### to #### nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the new york city area here the new york central railroad one of the nations most important carriers has alone lost ### percent of its passengers since #### at this time of crisis in our nations commuter railroads a new threat to the continued operations of the new york central has appeared in the form of the chesapeake & ohio railroads proposal for control of the baltimore & ohio railroads the new york central has pointed out that this control if approved by the interstate commerce commission would give the combined c & o b & o railroad a total of ### points served in common with the new york central 
the freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the c & o b & o provides the backbone of centrals revenues these revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire new york central system as well as the new york area commuter and terminal freight services if these services are to be maintained the new york central must have the revenues to make them possible the new york central today handles ## percent of all southbound commuter traffic coming into new york city this is a $## million operation involving #### employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively 
there is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful c & o b & o merger scheme the logic of creating a strong balanced competitive twosystem railroad service in the east is so obvious that b & o was publicly committed to the approach outlined here detailed studies of the plan were well underway though far from completion these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned their investors their customers their users and to the public at large then abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned b & o entered onagainoffagain negotiations with c & o which resulted in the present situation 
the interstate commerce commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed c & o b & o merger on june ## obviously the interstate commerce commission will not force the new york central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge however there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss that is will it serve the longrange public interest for the past ## years congress has advocated a carefully planned balanced and competitive railway system 
which will serve not only the best interest of the stockholders but the interests of all the traveling public mr speaker i rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper the new york times on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command arthur hays sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to american journalism on the occasion of his retirement i am pleased to note that mr sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the new york times mr sulzbergers successor as publisher is mr orvil e dryfoos who is president of the new york times co and who has been with the times since #### 
i am also pleased to note that mr john b oakes a member of the times staff since #### has been appointed as editorial page editor mr oakes succeeds charles merz editor since #### who now becomes editor emeritus i should like at this time mr speaker to pay warm tribute to arthur hays sulzberger and charles merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in american journalism my heartiest congratulations go to their successors orvil e dryfoos and john b oakes who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the new york times the people of the ##th district of new york and i as their representative in congress take great pride in the new york times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world 
yesterday i had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the us news & world report of may # which discussed this type of action in more detail including both its advantages and its disadvantages under leave to extend my remarks i include the relevant portion of my newsletter together with the text of the article from the us news & world report your congressman samuel s stratton reports from washington may # ####cuban ssr whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the castroheld mainland last week there was at least one positive benefit and that was the clearcut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russiandominated military base in fact one of the major reasons for the failure of the illstarred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which cuba has been getting this russian military equipment somehow the pictures and stories of soviet t## tanks on cuban beaches and russian mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark blunt truth of what it means to have a russian military base ## miles away from home 
once the full extent of this russian military penetration of cuba was clear president kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this even if we had to go it alone but the latin american republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing cuba off the interamerican defense board for years the united states had been trying to get these countries to exclude castros representative from secret military talks but it took the pictures of the migs and the t## tanks to do the job there is a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week 
efforts as i see it which are being directed by the way toward support for future actions not for those already past what the next move will be only time of course will tell personally i think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of cuba we simply cant tolerate further russian weapons including the possibility of longrange nuclear missiles being located in cuba obviously we cant stop them from coming in however just by talk 
 from us news & world report may # #### next for cuba an arms blockade look at castro now cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the americas in it they see a way to isolate cuba stop infiltration maybe finish castro too this is the question now facing president kennedy how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to communist infiltration of this hemisphere 
its aim to undermine further cubas economy another strategy bolder and tougher was also attracting notice in washington a naval and air blockade to cut cuba off from the world destroy castro blockade in the view of military and civilian experts could restore teeth to the monroe doctrine it could halt a flood of communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching castro it could stop cuban reexport of guns and propaganda materials to south america 
it is the strategy of blockade therefore that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials members of congress officers in the pentagon as a possible course of action it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions among these questions what would a cuba blockade take military experts say a tight naval blockade off cuban ports and at the approaches to cuban waters would require two naval task forces each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about ### planes and several destroyers the navy on april ## announced it is bringing back the carrier shangrila from the mediterranean increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of cuba 
to round out the blockading force submarines would be needed to locate identify and track approaching vessels a squadron of navy jets and another of longrange patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces three requirements go with a blockade it must be proclaimed the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it once these conditions of international law are met countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk 
they could be sent to us ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated in a broad sense it would reaffirm the monroe doctrine by opposing communist interference in the western hemisphere it could by avoiding direct intervention provide a shortofwar strategy to meet shortofwar infiltration primary target would be shipments of tanks guns aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from russia and czechoslovakia shipments of arms from western countries could similarly be seized as contraband 
at times three ships a day from the soviet bloc are unloading in cuban ports from its inception in #### with the passage of public law ### ##th congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the states by means of grantsinaid to return disabled men and women to productive gainful employment the authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as title # of the social security act in #### up to this time and for the next eight years the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training counseling and placement on a job recognizing the limitations of such a program the ##th congress in #### passed p l ### which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities and which revised the financing structure 
to assist the states therefore in rehabilitating handicapped individuals so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities the ##rd congress enacted the vocational rehabilitation amendments of #### p l ### these amendments to the vocational rehabilitation act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities for more sheltered and halfway workshops for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel for more comprehensive services to individuals particularly to the homebound and the blind and for other administrative improvements to increase the programs overall effectiveness under the law as it existed until #### the federal government made grants to the states on the basis of population matching state expenditures on a #### basis under p l ### ##th congress the federal government assumed responsibility for ###% of necessary state expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled and for ##% of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services throughout these years the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the act 
and # research demonstrations training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation and in addition for shortterm training and instruction the first part of the new structure that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services is described in this section subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure the following table shows for selected years the authorizations appropriations allotment base federal grants to states and state matching funds for this part of the grant program in order to assist the states in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services section # of the amended act provides that allotments to states for support of such services be based on # need as measured by a states population and # fiscal capacity as measured by its per capita income 
it stipulates in addition that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the ceiling and not used for insuring the floor be redistributed to those states still below their maximums these provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the states with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a state with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated state the provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in state programs already in operation which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone the method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the act the term state means the several states the district of columbia the virgin islands guam and puerto rico 
the following steps are employed in calculations # for each state except puerto rico guam the virgin islands and prior to #### alaska and hawaii determine average per capita income based on the last three years  see source of data below for per capita income data to be used in this step determine the average per capita income for the u s based on the last three years  see source of data below for per capita income data to be used in this step

 each states unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item ## below by a percentage greater than one and onehalf times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $######## must be reduced by the amount of the excess determine if the particular states unadjusted allotment result obtained in item ## above is less than its minimum base allotment and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment regardless of its unadjusted allotment each state is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year #### increased by a uniform percentage of ######## which brings total #### allotments to all states up to $######## the funds recouped by reductions in item ## above are used first to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those states where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment item ## above and second to increase uniformly the allotments to those states whose allotments are below their maximums with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceeding its maximum 
funds allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine as is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula prior to #### in order to provide matching for the minimum base allotment state funds had to equal #### state funds prior to and since #### the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the state with a pivot of ##% state or ##% federal participation in total program costs the percentage of federal participation in such costs for any state is referred to in the law as that states federal share 
beginning in #### the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted upward or downward as required ##% a year so that by #### the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a ##% pivot state share with maximum and minimum state shares of ##% and ##% respectively the pre#### rate of federal participation with respect to any states base allotment as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the #### #### period is designated by the statute as that states adjusted federal share the provisions for determining a states unadjusted federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the states the purpose of the adjusted federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates the method used for computing the respective federal and state shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the act 
the term united states includes the several states and the district of columbia and excludes the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior to #### alaska and hawaii the following steps are employed in the calculations # for each state except the virgin islands guam puerto rico and prior to #### alaska and hawaii determine the average per capita income for the last three years  the same amount used in item # under method of computing allotments above determine the average per capita income for the united states for the last three years

therefore sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance a blower may be installed to increase comfort a blower is essential for the doublewall shelter and for the underground shelters it should provide not less than # cubic feet per minute of air per person 
radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation as soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made it probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive conelrad broadcasts continuous lowlevel lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a #cell hotshot battery to which is wired a ###milliampere flashlighttype bulb tests have shown that such a device with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least ## days 
a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed there should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas  if there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter they should be shielded as shown in the appendix page ## other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the appendix page ## 
bunks or materials to build them may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed the basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection the radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first fortynine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about # percent of what it was an hour after the explosion but the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous 
radiation instruments suitable for home use are available and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation there is a possibility that batterypowered radios with builtin radiation meters may become available your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from state and federal sources it will tell you as soon as possible how long to stay in your shelter 
a checklist in the appendix page ## tells what is needed there should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake to break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy the survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio 
blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement however as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum the housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied food medical supplies utensils and equipment if not already stored in the shelter must be quickly gathered up and carried into it 
sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem a covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet a ##gallon garbage can with a tightly fitting cover could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully 
it would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning even if the electric power fails after an attack any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature warm clothing and bedding of course are essential some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need 
few areas if any are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about a family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation on the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside the best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house a belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to onetenth of the outside level 
if there is time after the warning the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking windows with bricks dirt books magazines or other heavy material large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings in general such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space the central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building with concrete floors should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling the basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling 
the problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management a former du pont official became a general motors vice president and set about maximizing du ponts share of the general motors market lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du pont products were actively promoted within a few years various du pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of general motors eight operating divisions 
competitors came to receive higher percentage of general motors business in later years but it is likely that this trend stemmed at least in part from the needs of general motors outstripping du ponts capacity the fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du ponts production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du pont by a stock interest the inference is overwhelming that du ponts commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit this court agreed with the trial court that considerations of price quality and service were not overlooked by either du pont or general motors however it determined that neither this factor nor the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone including du ponts competitors outweighed the governments claim for relief 
the latter provisions proscribe any contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and monopolization of or attempts combinations or conspiracies to monopolize such trade however this court put to one side without consideration the governments appeal from the dismissal of its sherman act allegations it rested its decision solely on # which reads in pertinent part no corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition or to restrain such commerce in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce this section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about the substantial lessening of competition 
section # is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which as a reasonable probability appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation the section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies or the substantial lessening of competition have occurred or are intended thus a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the courts decision indeed as already noted the court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du pont and general motors acted honorably and fairly and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies this however did not bar finding that du pont had become preeminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to general motors 
that general motors share of the market for these products was substantial and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns the statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customers stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute we repeat that the test of a violation of # is whether at the time of suit there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints the conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition 
the sole guidance given the court for discharging the task committed to it was this the judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the district court for a determination after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute the district courts in the framing of equitable decrees are clothed with large discretion to model their judgements to fit the exigencies of the particular case international salt co v united states ### u s ### ###### this brings us to the course of the proceedings in the district court 
the first pretrial conference held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of du pont and general motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings took place on september ## #### at the outset the governments spokesman explained that counsel for the government and for du pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court du pont he said had proposed disenfranchisement of its general motors stock along with other restrictions on the du pont general motors relationship the government deeming these suggestions inadequate had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du ponts shares of general motors counsel for the government invited du ponts views on this proposal before recommending a specific program but stated that if the court desired or if counsel for du pont thought further discussion would not be profitable the government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days 
no previous antitrust case he said had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief the submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract the court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out the government submitted its proposed decree on october ## #### the plan called for divestiture by du pont of its ######## shares of general motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders as a dividend over a period of ten years 
if in the trustees judgment reasonable market conditions did not prevail during any given year he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the tenyear period in addition the right to vote the general motors stock held by du pont was to be vested in du ponts stockholders other than christiana and delaware and the stockholders of delaware du pont christiana and delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over general motors du pont christiana and delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with general motors and vice versa and general motors and du pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by general motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du pont manufactured product or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by general motors to du pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of general motors or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies 
on may # #### the commissioner announced his rulings the annual dividends paid to du pont stockholders in shares of general motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du ponts earnings and profits the measure for federal income tax purposes of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution in the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or du ponts tax basis for them which is approximately $### per share the forced sale of the general motors stock owned by or allocable to christiana delaware and the stockholders of delaware and deposited with the trustee would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate 
under its plan du pont would retain its general motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares christiana and delaware would in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the general motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders du pont would be enjoined from having as a director officer or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of general motors and no director officer or employee of du pont could serve as a director of general motors without court approval du pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional general motors stock except through general motors distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders on june # #### general motors submitted its objections to the governments proposal 
that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies that the tremendous volume of general motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of general motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity general motors comprehensively contended that the government plan would not be in the public interest as required by the mandate of this court the decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed in august of #### 
both plans also prohibited common directors officers or employees between du pont christiana and delaware on the one hand and general motors on the other it is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude unnourished by sense to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship while it is easy enough to ridicule hawkins pronouncement in pleas of the crown from a metaphysical point of view the concept of the oneness of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage by making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which congress has afforded to the marriage relationship the court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in wyatt v united states ### us ### where the court held that under the circumstances of that case a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection one need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in american life which are also of great importance and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself 
the courts opinion dogmatically asserts that the husbandwife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine enthrones an unreality into a rule of law i am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed but in any event i submit that the power to depose belongs to congress not to this court petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector was convicted of violating ##a of the universal military training and service act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces he claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the fifth amendment because # at a hearing before a hearing officer of the department of justice he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board and # at the trial he was denied the right to have the hearing officers report and the original report of the federal bureau of investigation as to his claim 
petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings because the statement in question was in his file to which he had access and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the department of justice and before the appeal board petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officers notes and report especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the department of justices recommendation to the appeal board petitioner was not entitled either in the administrative hearing at the department of justice or at his trial to inspect the original report of the federal bureau of investigation since he was furnished a resume of it did not challenge its accuracy and showed no particular need for the original report haydn c covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner daniel m friedman argued the cause for the united states 
mr justice clark delivered the opinion of the court this is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed services in violation of the provisions of the universal military training and service act ## stat ###### ## usc app aj ### a petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector contends that he was denied due process both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the department of justice and at trial he says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board and further that he was denied at trial the right to have the department of justice hearing officers report and the original report of the federal bureau of investigation as to his claim all in violation of the fifth amendment the trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents 
we granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the act we have concluded that petitioners claims are controlled by the rationale of gonzales v united states ### us ### #### and united states v nugent ### us # #### and therefore affirm the judgment petitioner registered with local board no # boulder colorado on march ## #### his answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of jehovahs witnesses employed at night by a sugar producer he claimed #d classification as a minister of religion devoting a minimum of ### hours a month to preaching 
on november ## #### he wrote the board protesting this classification he again stated that he was a regular minister that he was devoting an average of ### hours a month to actual preaching publicly in addition to ## to ## hours in other ministerial duties and that he opposed war in any form on april # #### after some six months of fulltime pioneering petitioner discontinued devoting ### hours a month to preaching but failed to so notify his local board in a periodic review the local board on july ## #### reclassified him #a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home 
he was not prosecuted however and his case was subsequently reopened in the light of sicurella v united states ### us ### #### he was again reclassified #a by the local board there followed a customary department of justice hearing at which petitioner appeared in his report to the attorney general the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service on march ## #### however the department recommended approval of the #a classification 
it reported that he now devoted only some ##/# hours per month to public preaching and from ## to ## hours per month to church activities his claim was therefore so highly exaggerated the department concluded that it cast doubt upon his veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith the appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation in his answer thereto he advised the board that he had made no such statement in #### and asserted that his only claim to pioneering was in #### the appeal board however unanimously concurred in the departments recommendation 
petitioner first contends that the department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity before its final recommendation to the appeal board to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting ### hours to actual preaching but the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file he admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer this he failed to do asserting that he did not know it to be in his file apparently he never took the trouble to find out 
after the recommendation of the department is forwarded to the appeal board that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial we found in gonzales v united states supra that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant we said there that it was necessary that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut the departments recommendation when it comes to the appeal board the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification we fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioners contention which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it as was said in gonzales it is the appeal board which renders the selective service determination considered final in the courts not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact 
but there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult at his trial petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the departments hearing officer evensen as well as his report thereon petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original federal bureau of investigation reports to the department of justice he alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of investigation reports might disclose 
but there is nothing in the act requiring the hearing officers report to be likewise turned over to the registrant while the regulations formerly required that the hearing officers report be placed in the registrants file this requirement was eliminated in #### moreover the hearing officers report is but intradepartmental is directed to the attorney general and of course is not the recommendation of the department it is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of which the attorney general receives many and to which he may give his approval or rejection it is but part of the whole process within the department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board 
hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the department on file with the board petitioner knew that the departments recommendation was based not on the hearing officers report but on the statement of the local board in his file having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed it appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officers report and notes at the trial in addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes 
moreover his testimony at trial never developed any such facts in the light of these circumstances as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the departments recommendation which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record we find no relevancy in the hearing officers report and notes finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the fbi report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial he did receive a resume of it the same that was furnished the appeal board and he made no claim of its inaccuracy he bases his present contention on the general right to explore indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume 
there we held that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service system entitles [ conscientious objectors ] to no guarantee that the fbi reports must be produced for their inspection even if we were not bound by nugent petitioner here would not be entitled to the report the recommendation of the department as well as the decision of the appeal board was based entirely on the local board file not on an fbi report with this enlarged role in mind i should like to make a few suggestions what we in the united states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world we in this department must think about foreign policy in its total context 
foreign policy is the total involvement of the american people with peoples and governments abroad that means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must think in terms of the total context of our situation it is the concern of the department of state that the american people are safe and secure defense is not a monopoly concern of the department of defense it is also the concern of the department of state that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous profitable and active this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the department of commerce we can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve differences between this and other departments 
means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy i think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present the movement of events is so fast the pace so severe that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present 
action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control there will of course be times for delay and inaction what i am suggesting is that when we delay or when we fail to act we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties i also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas an affliction of all bureaucracies we want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the department 
i hope no one expects that only presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas the responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the department who has a policy function regardless of rank further i would hope that we could pay attention to little things while observing the operations of our government in various parts of the world i have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort to cite only a few examples the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior position abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy 
dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them i would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them if the department of state is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas this does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational interested responsible fashion 
he is expected to supervise to encourage to direct to assist in any way he can if any official operation abroad begins to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action it occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which i expressed privately in recent years in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside government i tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine 
his first thought is about the question itself is there a question here for american foreign policy and if so what is it for he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind he reaches a tentative identification of the question tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because if no tolerable answer can be found it may have to be changed into one which can be answered meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can never be complete and the general background much of which has already been lost to history he is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policyoriented conclusions 
he is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action including doing nothing he knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog but he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy wellestablished precedents the commitments of the united states under international charters and treaties basic statutes and wellunderstood notions of the american people about how we are to conduct ourselves in policy literature such as country papers and national security council papers accumulated in the department he will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted he must think about which of these principles must take precedence 
he is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole when the whole is too large to grasp he must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer who should be consulted among his colleagues in the department or other departments and agencies of the government which american ambassadors could provide helpful advice 
what is the probable attitude of other governments including those less directly involved how and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted if action is indicated what kind of action is relevant to the problem the selection of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself can the president or the secretary act under existing authority or will new legislation and new money be required 
is the matter one for the united nations or some other international body for if so the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem what type of action can hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it he is interested in public opinion for two reasons first because it is important in itself and second because he knows that the american public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind 
may i add a caution on this particular point we do not want policy officers below the level of presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action in the first place our business is foreign policy and it is the business of the presidential leadership and his appointees in the department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem mr truman emphasized this point by saying you fellows in the department of state dont know much about domestic politics if we sit here reading editorials and looking at publicopinion polls and other reports that cross our desks we should realize that this is raw undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership 
we cannot test public opinion until the president and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action i doubt for example that # months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the marshall plan any publicopinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals the problem in the policy officers mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors political military economic financial legal legislative procedural administrative to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control and the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels while there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women 
there should be no draft exemption because of peace corps service in most cases service in the corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment peace corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the united states nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid the guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services 
peace corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living they should live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts some special health requirements might have to be met for example it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers 
for readjustment to the us volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service based on the length of time served in what part of the government should the peace corps be established the idea of a peace corps has captured the imagination of a great many people support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines the peace corps therefore offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world an opportunity for the american people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development 
pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program the peace corps should be established as an agency in the department of state when the aid operations are reorganized the peace corps should remain a semiautonomous functional unit meanwhile the peace corps could be physically located in icas facilities and depend on the state department and ica for administrative support and when needed program assistance in this way the peace corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for united states foreign policy and our overseas operations how and when should the peace corps be launched 
the peace corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this years graduating classes will not be lost nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses if launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks the peace corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall within a year or two several thousand might be in service it can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated 
the need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest there would however be a variety of other skills medical agricultural engineering which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects the first years projects should also be spread through several countries in latin america africa and asia how will the peace corps be received abroad although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to receive it from the united states will vary from country to country 
unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility but there are indications that many developing nations will welcome peace corps volunteers and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends it is important however that the peace corps be advanced not as an arm of the cold war but as a contribution to the world community in presenting it to other governments and to the united nations we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the united nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee we should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands 
the peace corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership our aim must be to learn as much as we teach the peace corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the united states the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower if presented in this spirit the response and the results will be immeasurably better the already appropriated funds within the discretion of the president and secretary of state under the mutual security act are the only immediately available source of financing this summers pilot programs of the peace corps 
congress should then be asked to give the peace corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year specifically congress should consider authorizing the peace corps to receive contributions from american businesses unions civic organizations and the public at large for this must be the project of the whole american people an advisory council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding steps should also be taken to link the food for peace program with the peace corps so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of us surplus food under pl ### can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of peace corps personnel 
is it worth the cost and the risks no matter how well conceived and efficiently run there probably will be failures these could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad but as the popular response suggests the potentiality of the peace corps is very great it can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions 
it can also contribute to the education of america and to more intelligent american participation in the world with thousands of young americans going to work in developing areas millions of americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before with colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program and with students looking toward peace corps service there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness the letters home the talks later given by returning members of the peace corps the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible american policies toward the world and this is meeting the worlds need too since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world 
as you said in your state of the union message the problems are towering and unprecedented and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well i recommend to the congress the establishment of a permanent peace corps a pool of trained american men and women sent overseas by the us government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower i have today signed an executive order establishing a peace corps on a temporary pilot basis the temporary peace corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization in addition by starting the peace corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall 
its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires our own freedom and the future of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity liberated from the bonds of hunger ignorance and poverty one of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages the mountains the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations the vast task of economic development urgently requires skilled people to do the work of the society to help teach in the schools construct development projects demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge 
this organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice there is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them in #### onequarter of the ### million recreation visits to the national forests and grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing hunter and fisherman visits since #### have increased # times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses 
the longrange objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment the wildlife habitat management proposals for the ##year period are # revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources improve food and cover on ## million acres of key wildlife areas develop wildlife openings food patches and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on ###### acres 
the total adverse impact of disease insects fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized they kill and destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage values and disrupt uses the loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the united states in #### was estimated to be about ## billion board feet if it were not for the effect of destructive agencies sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the ## billion board feet in #### about ## percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease ## percent to insects ## percent to fire and ## percent to weather animals and various other causes 
the longrange objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and highlevel sustained yield of products and services this can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations in addition to direct protection measures more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease in the ##year period it is proposed that insect and disease control on the national forest system be stepped up to a level of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period this will require about a ## percent increase over the present level of protection 
 b more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage  c quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a largescale epidemic the initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to ###### acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production the objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed 
coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses it is proposed that in ## years all commercial timberlands all critical watersheds and other lands in the national forest system developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads this will include ### million acres compared with ## million acres now receiving such protection an additional ## million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for # 
this is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort detection skilled firefighting crews and equipment use this will include a steppedup program of training and development of personnel adoption and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention for suppression of fires while small and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to highvalue areas this work will cover the most serious onefourth of all land needing such treatment and will consist of burning ###### acres of highly hazardous debris concentration felling snags on ###### acres of high lightningoccurrence areas prescribed burning on ## million acres removing roadside fuel on ##### acres and clearing and maintaining ##### miles of firebreaks 
these areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the national forests approximately ## million acres of rangelands and ## million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known the transportation system which serves the national forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions this system is divided into a forest highway system administered by the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system administered by the secretary of agriculture 
in the forest highway system there are now ##### miles of public roads these are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the secretary of commerce with maintenance provided by the states and counties this development program for the national forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed it is estimated that about ##### miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the national forests in the forest development road and trail system there are now ###### miles of roads and ###### miles of supplemental foot and horse trails 
construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture it is estimated that about ###### miles of forest development roads and ##### miles of trails constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resources of the national forests on a continuing basis the ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds the presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as a 
the balanced use of recreation hunting and fishing areas the volume of timber that can be marketed especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire windstorm insects and disease the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals the existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes that is not otherwise possible 
use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve the longrange objective of this department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services for the year #### this means servicing a the protection requirements of a watershed producing at least ### million acrefeet of water each year b recreation and wildlife resources used each year by ### million visitors c a timber resource supporting an annual cut of ## billion board feet and d ## million acres of rangelands service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about ###### miles of new roads and #### miles of new trails along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about ###### miles of roads and ##### miles of trails about ##### miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads 
program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the ##year period ######## are as follows # complete the construction and reconstruction of about ##### miles of multiplepurpose roads and #### miles of trails this constitutes about ## percent of the longrange requirements for these facilities approximately ## percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of national forest timber but paid for by the government through adjustment of stumpage prices provide maintenance to full standards on the ###### miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period 
in some units national forest ownership is well blocked together in many others the previous patenting of land under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership within exterior boundaries of national forests and national grasslands there are about ######## acres in nonfederal ownership one consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring national forest or other federal land or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring national forest land some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these federal lands 
there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the eastern states the longrange objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized national forest programs such as recreation development or which are a source of damage to lands in national forests and national grasslands strategy and tactics of the us military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history the change of emphasis from conventionaltype to missiletype warfare must be made with care mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other 
 this budget will provide in the fiscal year #### for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level a yearend strength of ####### men and women in the active forces the forces to be supported include an army of ## divisions and ###### men a navy of ### active ships and ###### men a marine corps of # divisions and # air wings with ###### men and an air force of ## combat wings and ###### men 
quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers under modern conditions this is especially true of the ready reserve i have requested the secretary of defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare last year the congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the army reserve similar restrictions on the strength of the army national guard contained in the #### department of defense appropriation act should likewise be dropped 
i again proposed a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve from their present strengths of ###### and ###### respectively to ###### and ###### by the end of the fiscal year #### these strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives  about ##% of the expenditures for the department of defense in #### are for military personnel costs including pay for active reserve and retired military personnel these expenditures are estimated to be $### billion an increase of $### million over #### reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel more dependents an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay and social security tax increases effective for the full year in #### compared with only # months in #### retired pay costs are increased by $## million in #### over #### partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel 
traditionally rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel the #### military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a #% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of june # #### i endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates  expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the armed forces are estimated to be $### billion in #### which is $### million more than in #### the increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment 
also the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in #### causing an increase in expenditures further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the congress last year other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour up ##% in two years and of each steaming hour up ##% in total these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the armed forces in the budget message for #### and again for #### i recommended immediate repeal of section ### of the act of september ## #### ## stat ### 
as i have stated previously the attorney general has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles accordingly if it is not repealed by the congress at its present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise basic longline communications in alaska are now provided through federal facilities operated by the army air force and federal aviation agency the growing communications needs of this new state can best be met as they have in other states through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these governmentowned systems in alaska and its early enactment is desirable 
in #### these expenditures are estimated at $### billion compared to $### billion in #### the decreases which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles guns and electronic devices expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in #### new obligational authority for #### recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement excluding amounts for related research and construction totals $#### million which is $#### million below that enacted for #### on the other hand the new authority of $#### million proposed for missile procurement excluding research and construction in #### is $### million higher than for #### 
the department of defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items as i have repeatedly stated this provision is much more restrictive than the general law popularly known as the buy american act i urge once again that the congress not reenact this rider the task of providing a reasonable level of military strength without endangering other vital aspects of our security is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress the last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history 
furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological breakthrough on any one weapon system in itself often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems this has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events thus in the last few years a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated for example the importance of the regulus # a very promising aerodynamic shiptosurface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines another example is the recent cancellation of the f### a longrange interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid####s 
considering the high cost of the f### system over $# billion for the force that had been planned and the time period in which it would become operational it was decided to stop further work on the project meanwhile other air defense forces are being made effective as described later in this message the size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans notable in this category are the jupiter and thor intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed produced and deployed but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile the impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the highenergy fuel program 
continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means have now raised serious questions about the value of the highenergy fuel program as a result the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed these examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and farranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology the cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development in determining the most satisfactory rate of development and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it  the deterrent power of our armed forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war 
the second capability is represented by our deployed ground naval and air forces in essential forward areas together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement the strategic air command is the principal element of our longrange nuclear capability one of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the b## a longrange supersonic bomber this aircraft which was planned for initial operational use about #### would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems all of which are scheduled to become available earlier the first atlas icbms are now operational the first two polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year and the first titan icbms next year 
by #### several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established thus the need for the b## as a strategic weapon system is doubtful however i am recommending that development work on the b## airframe and engines be continued it is expected that in #### two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing by that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system 
these additional modern bombers will replace some of the older b## medium bombers one b## can do the work of several b##s which it will replace funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping of the b## wings with the hound dog airtosurface missile in the coming fiscal year additional quantities of atlas titan and polaris missiles also will be procured purchase authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale and delivery of commodities including the classes types and/or varieties of food grain the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees accruing from such sale and other relevant matters

the present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast am band from ### kc to #### kc whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of the other the extent of such interference which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations depends on many factors among the principal ones being the distance between the stations their respective radiated power and of particular significance here the time of day other factors playing a part in the extent of am service and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along the transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others with the existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the commission to make assignments of am stations on a casetocase basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances 
an example of the overall standards applied is the ##to# ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable by this standard it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved objectionable interference from station a exists at any point within the service area of station b where station as signal is of an intensity onetwentieth or more of the strength of station bs signal at that point the ##to# ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in am assignments and allocations that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service a second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies this is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere 
but during the middle daytime hours these skywave radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are in general negligible but during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere thereby creating the possibility of one stations rendering service via skywave at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the am band with many more stations operating during the day than at night it was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions and vice versa is not an instantaneous process but takes place over periods of time from roughly # hours before sunset until about # hours after sunset and again from roughly # hours before sunrise until some # hours after sunrise during the period of about # hours around sunset skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail 
however in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations representing an averaging of conditions and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions it was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this purpose accordingly the ###### rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations class # stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset for daytime class # stations or sunset at the location of the dominant class # station where located west of the class # station for limitedtime class # stations the same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class # stations operating on regional channels which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other 
these curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data it was recognized that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength for this reason the more uncertain skywave service was denominated secondary in our rules as compared to the steadier more reliable groundwave primary service and for both skywave service and skywave interference signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signalintensity level is exceeded ## percent of the time for skywave service ## percent of the time for skywave interference as mentioned the allocation of am stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations the rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the nation 
to provide some service to all listeners to provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible to provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized and to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others accordingly the commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations 
in dealing with these frequencies the objective listed first above provision of service to all listeners was predominant the class # stations on these clear channels are protected to their ##mv/m groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference with respect to skywave service rendered at night class # a stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the united states on clear channels specified for class # a operation and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received class # b stations are protected at night to their ##mv/m ##percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference only class # stations are capable of rendering skywave service 
with respect to other frequencies these are designated as regional or local and assigned for use by class # and class # stations respectively stations operating generally with lower power in the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of longrange service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible as mentioned the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service free from destructive interference during nighttime hours because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it therefore under our longstanding allocation rules on some of these channels no station other than the dominant class # a station is permitted to operate at night so that the # a station can render service interference free wherever it can be received 
in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels additional class # assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class # stations or to each other and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities such additional daytime class # assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies and the commission has over the years made a large number of them similarly on the regional channels many class # stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power essentially the question presented for decision in the present daytime skywave proceeding is whether our decision in ######## to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset is sound as a basis for am allocations or whether in the light of later developments and new understanding skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours 
since then there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena in #### affidavits were filed with the commission by various clearchannel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours from class # stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference if you elect to use the standard deduction or the tax table and later find you should have itemized your deductions you may do so by filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim for refund see you may claim a refund page ### the same is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should have used the standard deduction or tax table

the one or twoseason hunt of which there have been too many recently may do more harm than good for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued and they are dashed no less by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit for the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time the central group of the foundations advisors are at any one period of time the members of our advisory board consisting now of thirtysix men and women 
their locations in all parts of the united states and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the trustees minds for this concept of an advisory board ancillary to the board of trustees we are indebted to the late president of harvard university a lawrence lowell a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration that we had the wit and wisdom to adopt mr lowells concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been it may be said truly pretty uniformly good for in accordance with mr lowells concept of an advisory board our selections are made by experienced selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes and our choices and lest we should become too consistent in the sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts the foundations board of trustees maintains a trickle not a flow 
two committees of members of the advisory board constitute the committees of selection one for the selection of fellows from canada the united states and the englishspeaking caribbean area and one for the selection of fellows from the latin american republics and the republic of the philippines to the members of our advisory board and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection the foundation is indebted for its successes of choice of fellows we are as we know utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get and quality of advice added to devotion to the foundations purposes and ideals we do get from our advisory board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day but the facts about our advisory board and its members duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice both reliable and imaginative on which to base our selections of fellows 
and besides there are a large number of scholars artists composers of music novelists poets essayists choreographers lawyers servants of government and men of affairs hundreds indeed who serve the foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their experience to all the foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are it is a truism of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management during the biennium reviewed in this report our board of trustees named able men younger than the rest of us to the board and to top management to insure future continuance of the firstclass administration of the foundations affairs dr james brown fisk physicist president of the bell telephone laboratories was elected to the board of trustees 
and he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions dr gordon n ray provost vicepresident and professor of english in the university of illinois was appointed associate secretary general the trustees of the foundation appointed dr ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present secretary general upon the latters eventual retirement dr ray is a fellow of the foundation appointed thrice to assist his studies of william makepeace thackeray and of h g wells and before his appointment to the foundations executive staff had been given our highest scholarly accolade appointment to the advisory board referring further to the foundations officers dr james f mathias for eleven years our discerning colleague as associate secretary was promoted to be secretary 
also appointed to the foundations staff as assistant secretary is mr j kellum smith jr mr smith like the present secretary general is a lawyer and lawyers with the great virtues that they are trained to read the fine print carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields are indispensable even in a foundation office the present secretary general has been the foundations principal administrative officer continuously since the foundations establishment thirtyfive years ago but even he will not last indefinitely and the abovenoted new arrangements are quite simply made to assure qualitative continuity in the foundations policies and practices 
we are not given to lamentations neither personally nor in these reports on the contrary if this be an apocalyptic era as is commonly said we see it as an era of opportunity for granting that there are great presentday problems to be solved these problems make great demands and by their demanding tend to create resources of mens minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth of this examples are legion pericles speaking his funeral oration in ancient greeces extremity after thermopylae and making it a testament of freedom 
christ preaching the sermon on the mount close to his ultimate sacrifice shakespeare speaking with the indescribable gusto of the elizabethan voice keatss words in the days of the spanish armadas threats isaac newton at the age of twentythree industriously calculating logarithms to two and fifty places during the great plague year in england #### winston churchills olympian optimistic and resolute sayings when britain stood alone against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago 
forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit as the roman poet virgil declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today it gives indeed cause for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of the past produced and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind for example out of the social evils of the english industrial revolution came the novels of charles dickens and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all western men until today in the industrialized west these social evils substantially do not exist 
these were educated men who as mr justice holmes was fond of saying formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility that is to put it realistically they had to run their businesses at a profit or they had to get the votes to get elected nevertheless they made naught of marxs prophecy that capitalism would never pay the workers to use marxs word more than a subsistence wage with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists pockets with the result in turn that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase but as all understand who have eyes to see nothing of the kind has happened the gulf between the rich and the poor has narrowed in the industrialized western world to the point that the word poor is hardly applicable 
some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit and even putting it that way would not prove that marx was anything but wrong sir henry sumner maine a hundred years before communism was a force to be reckoned with wrote his brilliant legal generalization that the progress of society is from status to contract the essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do hence the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice 
the greater the range of choice the greater the rate of change for change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future but when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose men individual men must remain in status and society does not cannot progress the eternal truth is that progress due as it always is to individual creative genius is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart and lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report let me enlighten them with the truths that under communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the foundation and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the fellows might proceed untrammeled in every way toward their discoveries their creative efforts for the good of mankind 
as heretofore our fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts we do not favor one field over another we think that all inquiry all scholarly and artistic creation is good provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life as all firstrate scholarship and artistic creation does indeed if pressed we would say what the late robert henri american painter said to a pupil anything will do for a subject its what you do with it that counts thus we have no part and want none in current discussions of the relative importance of science the social studies the humanities the creative arts we want no part in such discussions because we think them largely futile 
when the brown & sharpe manufacturing company reached its ###th year as a going industrial concern during #### it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world with its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution brown & sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder joseph r brown and a worldrenowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology joseph r brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of new england between #### and #### he was early exposed to the mechanical world and in his youth often helped his father david brown master clock and watchmaker as he plied his trade at the age of ## he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of walcott & harris in valley falls rhode island and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation he went into business for himself in #### making lathes and small tools 
the years of josephs partnership with his father were numbered in #### a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter david brown moved west to illinois settling on a land grant in his declining years joseph brown continued in business by himself quickly rebuilding the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world much of his genius of course sprang from his familiarity with clock movements during these early years the repair of watches and clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed an important part of the young mans occupation 
but his business also grew and we are told that mr brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire it must have been with some pleasure and relief that on september ## #### joseph brown made the momentous entry in his job book in his characteristically cryptic style lucian sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice the young apprentice apparently did well by mr brown for in the third year of his apprenticeship lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm the company became j r brown & sharpe and entered into a new and important period of its development mr sharpes arrival in the business did indeed provide what mr brown had most coveted time for tinkering and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time 
the basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in #### by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine that development in turn formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years in gear cutting in circular graduating in index drilling and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement throughout their careers both mr brown and mr sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades several efforts were made in this direction and though not all of them survive to this day the brown & sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the american standard and is still in common use today as one development followed another the companys reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture 
as the story goes mr gibbs who originally came from the back counties of the commonwealth of virginia saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous howe sewing machine curious as to what made it work he built a crude model of it in wood and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread enabling the crude machine to take stitches when he showed this model as his solution as to how the howe sewing machine operated he was told he was wrong and discovered to his amazement that the howe machine which was unknown to him in detail used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one thus was invented the single thread sewing machine which mr gibbs in partnership with mr willcox decided to bring to brown & sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture the new work was a boon to the partnership not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of j r brown toward yet further developments for production equipment 
mr brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock and reversible tap and die holders in #### mr browns attention was called to yet another basic production problem the manufacture of twist drills at that time during the civil war union muskets were being manufactured in providence and the drills to drill them were being handfiled with rattail files this process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor mr browns imagination of the possibilities in the situation the child of this problem was mr browns famous serial no # universal milling machine the archtype from which is descended todays universal kneetype milling machine used throughout the world 
during the civil war period mr brown also invented the brown & sharpe formed tooth gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the worlds gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth but they were good for only one sharpening as soon as the time came for resharpening the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made this process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated resharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form mr browns invention achieved this and as a byproduct formed the cornerstone of brown & sharpes position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the ####s when superceded by other methods 
although mr brown was not himself its inventor it was a french idea it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use so it was that when mr brown and mr sharpe first saw the french tool on exhibition in paris in #### they brought a sample with them to the united states and started brown & sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day the final achievement of mr browns long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine that achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine which made its appearance in #### at the philadelphia centennial exposition this machine like its milling counterpart was the antecedent of a machinefamily used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world 
following mr browns death there came forward in the brown & sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company as head of the firm darling & swartz mr darling began by challenging brown & sharpe to its keenest competition during the ####s and early ##s in #### however a truce was called between the companies and the partnership of darling brown & sharpe was formed between that year and the buying out of mr darlings interest in #### a large portion of the companys precision tool business was carried out under the name of darling brown & sharpe and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of mr browns tradition for accuracy was mr oscar j beale whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of mr brown and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled brown & sharpe to manufacture gages and therefore its products with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world 
mr viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men he was an ardent champion of the brown & sharpe apprentice program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company in one sense it can be said that one of the most important brown & sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad commencing with the death of lucian sharpe in #### the name of henry d sharpe was for more than ## years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company during his presidency the companys physical plant was enormously expanded and the length and breadth of the brown & sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world 
during these years the companys product line followed the basic tenets laid down by mr brown it expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines from simple formedtooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business from rudimentary beltdriven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled kneetype and manufacturing type milling machines in the grinding machine field expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders surface grinders and a wide variety of special and semispecial models in #### henry d sharpe jr succeeded his father and continued the companys development as a major factor in the metalworking equipment business the company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts 
recently added is the brown & sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development in the industrial products division the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment machinists tools including micrometers vernier calipers and accessories in the cutting tool division the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters end mills and saws sales and net income for the year ended december ## #### showed an improvement over #### net income was $####### or $### per share on ###### common shares currently outstanding as compared to $####### or $### per share in #### adjusted to the same number of shares 
this increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development in spite of the fact that our largest market the textile industry was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year #### at a rate materially higher than during #### our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed our production for #### will be lower than for #### however the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of #### in connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sounder u s income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis could if adopted have favorable effects on leesonas business in the next few years 
our research and development program serving as it does an industry which must compete against lowcost production throughout the world continues to have primary emphasis at leesona this program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values fabrics whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment in terms of efficiency and versatility but more important we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the unifil loom winder and our more recent uniconer automatic coning machine on this basis our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to leesonas future growth in sales and earnings 
in december we began to ship our ultrahighspeed stretch yarn machines these machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics during the past year great progress has been made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved wash and wear dresses and blouses made from these fabrics this machine operating at speeds up to ###### revolutions per minute is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today 
our new largepackage ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers mills later in the year additional types of this leesona twister will be made available to mills for other manmade fibers and natural yarns these machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds larger yarn packages and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn this we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment major activity at providence in #### will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the uniconer automatic coning machine 
this machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry the potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the unifil loom winder the uniconer has several outstanding features it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment it incorporates an automatic knottying device on each spindle and it will knot a break in the yarn in ## seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted because the bobbintocone winding process is a relatively highcost operation for the mill the almost complete automation provided by the uniconer can mean important economies in textile production at the same time upgrading quality 
a new application for the unifil loom winder running single filling for box looms will broaden mill use of this equipment a new spinning takeup machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our takeup machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns it is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed this new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to #### feet per minute it is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time 
we look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field we are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods or components for industrial products and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction our patterson moos research division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells the cooperation of our exclusive american licensee pratt & whitney aircraft division of united aircraft corporation has been important in this work in addition to its major effort on fuel cells patterson moos research division is continuing to carry on research in other fields both under contract for the defense department other government agencies and for our own account 
we have recently entered into an agreement with compagnie generale de telegraphie sans fil csf of france for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials the agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the united states initially we will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from france but later we will manufacture in this country there is a rapidly growing demand for this material primarily from the military further research we believe will develop important commercial applications 
we are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity the rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation our plan is to keep abreast of these advances and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities early in august we broke ground for a new $####### plant in warwick rhode island which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations construction is well along and the plant is scheduled for completion in november of this year 
operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in #### an architects sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover the building will contain ###### square feet approximately the same as our present plant however its modern onestory layout is designed to increase our production capacity permit more efficient manufacturing and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs a major consideration in the choice of the warwick site four miles from cranston was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force 
during the year our british subsidiary leesonaholt limited expanded its plant in darwen england and added machine tool capacity the operations of its other plant in rochdale and leesonas former operations in manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of heywood layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis the area available at heywood is approximately three times the size of the former rochdale and manchester locations in addition land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future 
it will be transfered on completion to the industrial foundation of rhode island a nonprofit organization which will reimburse us for the cost of construction we will then occupy the new plant under lease with an option to purchase these arrangements are in our opinion very favorable to leesona interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from the chase manhattan bank in addition to expenditures on the warwick plant we have invested approximately $####### for machinery and equipment at cranston and for new machinery plant and equipment at leesonaholt limited 
long term loans have been reduced by $###### to $####### inventories increased $###### to $####### during the year and should decline in coming months thus we enter #### in a strong financial position in accordance with the twoyear contract signed in may #### with the international association of machinists aflcio wages of hourly employees were increased by #% in may #### and pay levels for nonexempt salaried employees were increased proportionately in addition blue cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semiprivate hospital accommodations 
during the pension year ended december ## #### ## employees retired making a total of ### currently retired under the companys pension plan at december ## #### the fund held by the industrial national bank of providence as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan totaled $####### the basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began ## years ago another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living as in many other industries rising costs and intense competition both domestic and foreign have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years 
as a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility the problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration production must be adjusted accordingly at minimum cost and quickly in addition production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics as well as blends following the term of service in japan each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community 
the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining under skilled direction the choir the orchestra the band the glee club and smaller ensembles of wind and string players all students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify orchestra band and choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes the glee club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership 
student musical organizations are the knights of carleton and the overtones mens vocal groups and the keynotes a womens singing group these studentdirected organizations include eight to ten members each from the founding of the college those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion courses are offered in ethics the philosophy and history of religion christian thought and history and the bible carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students 
the sermons are given by the college chaplain by members of the faculty or by guest preachers music is furnished by the carleton college choir these services at which attendance is voluntary are led by the chaplain by the president of the college by selected faculty members students and visitors the service is brief and variety in forms of worship is practiced a sunday evening program provides theological lectures music drama and films related to the issues of the judeochristian tradition 
each semester every student must attend ten of the services or religious meetings the ymca and ywca at carleton are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry out their general purposes occasional meetings are held for the whole membership usually with a guest speaker while smaller discussion groups meet more frequently the associations sponsor many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new friendships to broaden their interests and to engage in worthwhile service projects there are other organizations representing several of the denominational groups 
student religious organizations are coordinated under the religious activities committee a standing committee of the carleton student association the northfield churches include the following alliance congregationalbaptist episcopal lutheran norwegian danish missouri synod and bethel methodist moravian pentecostal and roman catholic the purpose of producing plays at the college is threefold to provide the carleton students with the best possible opportunity for theatergoing within the limits set by the maturity and experience of the performers and the theatrical facilities available to encourage the practice of attending the theater and to develop a discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive performance 
for the ######## season the carleton players have announced blood wedding by federico garcia lorca the knight of the burning pestle by beaumont and fletcher and a moon for the misbegotten by eugene oneill with a preseason production of the glass menagerie by tennessee williams this workshop located in boliou hall provides facilities for students to work in ceramics weaving enameling welding woodworking textile printing printmaking and lapidary these extracurricular activities are conducted under supervision of the director of the student workshop the workshop is open five afternoons and two evenings each week a student organization bottega is open to any student interested in increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic arts in their historical technical and productive contexts

weekend activities for the entire campus are planned by the coop board in recent months much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future and yet despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade #### has been a good year in many ways with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole the shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle this caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level 
factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years while those at retail are below #### the total value of our industrys shipments at factory prices increased from $## billion in #### to approximately $### billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business home entertainment military industrial and replacement i believe a further gain is in prospect for #### reflecting the largest percentage of highend sets such as consoles and combinations since #### dollar value of home entertainment electronics in #### was about $## billion compared to $## billion in #### sales of tv sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of #### through july 
for the year as a whole retail sales of tv sets probably came to ## million against ## million in #### however production came to only ## million compared to ## million in contrast to the lower turnout of tv total radio production increased from ### million sets to ### million excluding export both home and auto radios were in excellent demand with retail sales of home sets ahead of #### in every month of the first eleven sales and production of home sets were about equal at ### million units 
separate phonographs also had a good year reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radiotv market the outlook for entertainment electronics in #### is certainly far from clear at present but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods i would expect that sales at retail in the first half of #### might be below #### by some ## ##% but that secondhalf levels should show a favorable comparison with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will i look for tv sales and production to be approximately equal at ## million sets for the year but i look for some decline in radios from the high rate in #### to more nearly the #### level of ### ### million sets i therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $## million slightly below #### but above #### 
it is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industrys total sales to all markets in ######## which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance it has been correctly pointed out by wellinformed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of ##% or better that characterized the decade of the ####s and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability while this may well be true in general i believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the polaris and b## programs strengthening of the airborne alert system of the strategic air command and improved battlefield surveillance systems research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite samos and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as nikezeus are expected to increase substantially 
still later the realm of space technology will show substantial gains it has been estimated that spending by the national aeronautics and space administration will rise from less than $### million in fiscal #### to more than $# billion by #### and that the electronic industrys share of these expenditures will be closer to ##% than the current ##% the steppedup defense procurement called for in the #### budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it and it has been suggested that an additional $# billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal #### although the impact of these increases on our industrys shipments will be gradual on balance i look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year to at least $# billion paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $## billion compared to $## billion in #### 
informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late ####s under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing industrial process control and information storage and retrieval in the industrial field prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright for the near term however it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market and for this reason i would expect that any gain in #### may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years sales should slightly exceed #### however and reach $## billion in addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year 
the markets for electronic parts in #### have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates in the military field incoming orders turned down early in the year and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components sales of transistors in #### exceeded $### million compared to $### million in #### despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types production totalled about ### million units against ## million in #### and i look for a further gain to ### million units worth approximately $### million in #### 
in sum i look for another good year for the electronics industry in #### with total sales increasing about #% to $### billion despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally as i have indicated above i base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the fullyear figures close to those of #### on prospects for continued increases in defense spending and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the ####s the appointment of gilbert b devey as general manager of vectrol engineering inc of stamford connecticut a leading manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical controls has been announced by david b peck vice president special products 
mr brown will at the same time undertake expansion of vectrols custom design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff mr deveys new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of spragues special products group which manufactures a wide line of digital electronic components packaged component assemblies and high temperature magnet wires mr devey first came to sprague in #### as a product specialist in the field engineering department coming from the office of naval research in washington d c where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare studies during world war # he was a lieutenant commander in the united states navy mr devey is a graduate of the massachusetts institute of technology and attended the united states naval academy postgraduate school specializing in electronic engineering 
mr devey is a member of the institute of radio engineers and is chairman of the electronic industries association committee on printed and modular components mr brown wellknown englishborn inventor prior to founding vectrol was at various times section leader in radio research at metropolitan vickers electrical co ltd chief engineer of the radio set division of electric and musical industries ltd the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in great britain director of engineering at philco of great britain ltd and vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president at the brush development co cleveland ohio he has a bachelor of science from the university of manchester england 
he is a fellow of the american institute of electrical engineers and a senior member of the institute of radio engineers he is a member of the institution of electrical engineers london a registered professional engineer in connecticut and ohio and a chartered electrical engineer in great britain the promotion of robert e swift to the position of assistant manager of the interference control field service department was announced early in december by frederick s scarborough manager of interference control field service the appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electromagnetic compatability problems between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters 
since faculty see themselves as selfemployed professionals rather than as employees enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course the faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship the president expects faculty members to remember in exercising their autonomy that they share no collective responsibility for the universitys income nor are they personally accountable for toplevel decisions he may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy but he has a right to expect in return that they will leave administrative matters to the administration how well do faculty members govern themselves 
they sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government they too need to learn to delegate letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention although faculties insist on governing themselves they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government there are nevertheless several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege 
he can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the actionoriented faculty by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration complaints of a lack of communication persist the cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose 
the need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation to increase faculty influence and decrease tension many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly the president has little influence in daybyday curricular changes but if he looks ahead two three or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas he can open the way for innovation and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take success will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogatives patience and persistence the critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands 
they serve not only as spokesmen for their areas but they also contribute to toplevel decision making the president who appoints strong men who have an allcollege or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance faculty members depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration the administration at the same time looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments one way that this can be done other than by hiring new highpriced professors is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance 
by supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards the president can encourage faculty leadership indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to the academic dean should take a direct longterm interest in faculty development an alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs plans for the future qualifications of those on the job and bright prospects elsewhere for the maintenance of a longterm program the departments and particularly their chairmen are strategic 
to provide an independent judgment for the president the academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly at some colleges and universities a faculty committee reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates some faculty members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat departments actions or act pro forma they can be effective however if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work at one university the president cites the faculty review committee as a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty 
the president or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind no good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria to avoid passing over quiet unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by their departments there are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the mans former achievements 
in particular the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale on those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action a true university like most successful marriages is a unity of diversities without forcing all components into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest level which a university in contrast to a multiversity should stand for recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institutionwide goals each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core for all undergraduates 
in the first instance adequate appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be planned in the second more shops laboratories and staff will be required for the president a master plan looking ahead five years the maximum reach for sound forecasting offers several practical advantages trustees faculty and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made instead of afterwards physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed 
more than one president has found that a longrange plan helps him to attract major gifts it inspires confidence in his institutions determination to establish goals and to achieve them before deciding where it is going however a college or university must know where it is the first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty by outside consultants or by a combination of the two it should sternly appraise curricula faculty organization buildings faculty work loads and potential for growth in stature and size 
some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically funds may be readily donated for some purposes but not others a plan must therefore be brought up to date periodically possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer to provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research some offices have very broad responsibilities touching on almost all aspects of a universitys instructional program 
more often these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data the presidents opportunity for influencing education reaches its highest point as he decides which projects he will cut back which he will advance by increased allowances or new fundraising efforts no matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents when the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the presidents budget to which his faith and credit are committed its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment 
he reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money an institution should choose its fields of prominence otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy at worst and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branches of learning in the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the joneses in all branches 
here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role in the areas that do not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinates will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention the president should find strong subordinates and delegate the widest discretion to them higher education cannot compete with the salary scales of the business world but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income just as the entire faculty should know the presidents educational philosophy and objectives so should nonacademic officers 
they neither liked nor disliked the old man to them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after mass and at noon and at six each evening its tone repetitive monotonous never breaking the boredom of the streets yet if he were not there they would have missed him as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early june or the smell of thick tomato paste the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in flydotted cheesecloth or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights 
they never called him by name although he had one filippo rossi thats what he was called in the old country but here he was just signore or the old man but this was not unusual because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders it went to church on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession 
the only thing unusual about the old man had long since happened but the past was dead here as the present was dead once the old man had had a wife and once she too ignored him with a tiny furpiece wrapped around her shoulders she wiggled her satincovered buttocks down the street before him and didnt stop 
the way she strutted down the street the old man would have been blind not to have noticed both without looking at him without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of her she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars rode away in it and never came back  but she shouldnt have come here in the first place the women had said she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from torino just because she had a part on the stage in the old country she thought she could carry her head higher than ours 
calloused fingers caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted never to be tweezed away mauvecolored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of mans tongue had not smiled but had condemned again and again but if the old man even thought about his wife now nobody cared a fig it was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance as thin as the seams on her stockings and still thinner his voice had not commanded her to stop 
but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him  and his eyes those miniature sundials of variegated yellow had not altered their expression or direction the old mans very soul could have left him and flown down that street but he wouldnt have had anyone know it perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife but when he called for his withered wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar 
for all he saw or cared to see this could have been a town in italy not the outskirts of philadelphia it could have been bari or chieti for the way it smelled what did it matter to him that the park at the foot of ash road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the citys center at halfhour intervals or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the schuylkill this place was hatred to him just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness 
sameness for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city sameness lined the streets with twostory houses the color of ash it slashed the sloping manurescented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches it swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors even the stablegarage which housed nothing now but the scent of rot had a lawn before it 
the hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it only one house on the street had no lawn before it it squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade above it from a secondstory showroom wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood did the old man remember them there 
only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences where one mans property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy love and hatred and fear were one here shaded only by fig trees and grape vines and the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch the old man silently fed upon these streets waiting for what and for whom only he could tell and would not 
the old mans son threw himself down belly first upon a concrete step taking in the coolness of it and dreaming of the day he would be rich at fifteen he didnt care that he had no mother that he couldnt remember her face or her touch neither did he care that aunt rose provided for him he was named pompeii as a tribute to his heritage and he couldnt have cared less about that either to him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep 
he would not be like the rich americans who lived in whitecolumned houses on the other side of the park he would not ride the eightthirty local to the city each morning he would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running bowing with her running calling out in her bowing at your service he would order her to bring coffee and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff he would not remove his gloves and light and smoke 
he called to his sister on the porch above the steps she was only ten months older than he  laura what would you say if i smoked a pipe she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence brushing and drying her wet gilded hair in the sun one lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking torn pales 
all the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her chest her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii it was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours the eyes blue and always somewhat downcast possessed a sullen quality even though the boy could not see them he knew they were clouded by distance 
pompeii called again laura but the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it  shes in a mood he thought theres not a month she doesnt get herself in a mood well what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about and as for his pipe if he wanted to smoke one nobody would stop him 
above the tongue an aged yellow eye sallow and timecast encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin stared unfalteringly at him  christ sake goat git  youre boiling milk aint you soothing it with his hand knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch his head undulated gradually covering space to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats 
the boys fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player pressing and pulling delighting in what he did above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane but the boy could see only the goats belly the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over him sensing something portentous in it 
there would be time enough perhaps the old man reassured himself to pay the devil his due in the meantime six sandals stained an ocher the same color as pompeiis shaved hair edged up close to him the clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to niobe the neatest ones to concetta and the laced ones to romeo concettas idiot brother pompeii expected romeos small body to sink closer and closer to the ground 
people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it the room filled with smoke and maggies head throbbed with excitement and fatigue but stuart had such a happy earnest look of proud possession on his face that maggie couldnt bear to do anything to quench it little anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery in two months she became a fat highly social baby with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head she stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food 
she was so heavy that maggies arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her maggie couldnt seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back there was the daily round of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating worry had a great deal to do with it stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his fathers office taking what salary his father could hand out to him 
maggie and stuart pored over figures every night trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more in desperation maggie consulted eugenia one afternoon do you think you could find me something i could do here at home to make some money so i could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things  it seems to me you have enough to do as it is eugenia said she had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again  i have plenty of odd moments when i could be doing something maggie said 
 i should think so eugenia said  for one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day  shes so beautiful and i do like to keep her looking nice she picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck  shell be just as beautiful in something that doesnt have to be ironed eugenia said 
 evadna mae evans got all her baby clothes from bests liliputian bazaar in new york and im sick and tired of hearing about evadna mae evans  well now maggie you dont have to snap at me eugenia said  im just thinking of a way for you to be sensible i do seem to snap at everybody these days but i would like to think of a way to make a little extra money lets make a list of your assets 
when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures  i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers eugenia said  we could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where its nice and sunny but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and chris said you were to be careful about that  you might set up a dress shop in the living room  every woman in the block has tried that 
you could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes and grandma isnt strong enough to take on something like that and to tell you the truth neither am i she said well those are the really interesting things but if you dont like any of those i can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you if you think you can type well enough  oh im sure i could do that maggie said  but it really wouldnt be fair taking your jobs away from you 
maggie was looking much happier already clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there and be brushing up on her typing so eugenia wouldnt be ashamed of it  and then whenever i have a minute i can be working at it and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time and i can go back to my contests and be thinking while im doing the washing  what are you going to do with your feet so you dont waste anything she said oh eugenia i wish 
it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days the cold settled like a tangible pall over the mile high city locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance it had a look of grim stark realism resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold instead of the sprawling bumptious openhanded greedy western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices outside newspaper buildings in parks in relief lines outside government agencies 
there never had been a need felt for such facilities that kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries protected by discriminatory freight rates the east was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression dragging the west along and now the east was creating government agencies for which the west doubtless would have to pay the government offices were being opened but they werent being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything 
it was the theme song of millions of american people their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government the abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day something had to be done about the furnace the fuel bills the washing machine the doctor and dentist bills about making money stretch for food for the mortgage for taxes for shoes for half soles for overshoes for clothes for the new leaks in the roof for gas and light bills about keeping warm about keeping well about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once twice fifty times a day just dropping the babys bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster 
cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up under doors around loosened window frames from the sleeping porches the attic from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed and the fireplaces and an electric heater in grandmas room it was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive the pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms they moved maggies bed and the babys basket there and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds 
 you said a mouthful eugenia said grimly eugenia hated being cold worse than anything and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin she said to maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever  plenty of people are poor all their lives  plenty of people havent our brains and talent 
 youre working up to something and if you dont watch out youll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the abernathy family is superior to everything even a depression  the only thing that worries me is how im going to prove it eugenia said they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out and that she hoped to die in privacy like a christian and if the lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way she didnt want to be the only one with a stove in her room especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway and she insisted that hope have the heater hope wouldnt hear of it and she took the heater back to grandmas room and grandma took it back to hopes room and the two of them dragged it back and forth until grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire 
eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way but hope said if grandma wouldnt have the heater nobody would have it so grandma had to give in  thrifty of her to use it up unusual in a case like this but hed mentioned it himself at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that tolley had left because jenny had jilted him for roy robards  it was plain as the nose on your face that theyre laughing about it mamma 
 we will both go back laban  let me stay and take the pictures you wanted mamma why should i want pictures of an empty room now tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little jenny this trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants and i am going to see that everybody at mt pleasant understands that simple fact 
frank followed her into the bedroom hooked her dress up the back theyre not going to laugh at the fairbrothers and labans very long you know it and ill tell everybody exactly how it happened she was so beautiful so valiant so pitiable  make your confession to god kizzie dear not to the congregation 
i was so cruel to tolley so unfair he is coming back isnt he frank returning to the loghouse he found some favorite lines from jonathan swift on his lips he questioned gods taking time to telegraph the message but he felt better about kizzie and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole wondering why he had preserved it if he died before she did she would never be unable to resist opening it 
it was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing  youve told god frank he said  why lacerate the congregation reaching for an old clay pot relic of pioneer days he tore the envelope in pieces dropping them into it touching the little pyre to flame watching it curl the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash surely now his beloved son could rest in peace 
a beautiful and haunting line a subtle genius swinburne difficult not to envy a gifted man and perhaps he did but there were great satisfactions even for a small man beyond his window were the greening trees new spring eternal hope eternal life there lay grand fairs quinzaine his own young parents graves but new life and promise for his sons grandsons he poured his thimble of wine for the toast hed made so often 
mr robards jenny was the only person she knew of in the mt pleasant neighborhood who called him that was kind but too easygoing it didnt bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say howdy miss jenny adding a careless roy but it did her he could put a stop to it she told him again and again simply call mr whipsnade oscar and dr dunne pga and cun major frank mr robards laughed said hed feel a damn fool plainout couldnt do that even to please her 
and dont tell me you didnt at church sunday he really hadnt meant to he assured her but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on mr robards how strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings and fail her in spiritual ways another weakness far more irritating than his manner of speaking which he made only token effort to change was his devotion to that old horse of tolleys but mr robards now oh my yes indeed yes 
he with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or whatnots out there in the barn was reverent only of the mare the racin mare the revolting gunny for the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about gunny going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall nerves mr robards said just a nip anyway  stand back miss jen shes oneasy of your scarf never quit that you sorl devil 
she musnt annoy gunny whose foal was due then too listening for hours to his laments that the war and mist fairs poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant tolley the indifference with which the fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition her disgusting swollen stomach human birth was no novelty to mr robards tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick he suggested 
the chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came she was sure he would be in the barn or riding for the veterinarian night after night he stayed with gunny in the dead of winter rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house yet when the dear baby came he had tillie over here in a jiffy and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been jenny wished now that she had had dr dunne feeling that somehow he wouldnt have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets 
rhyme em up cute arcilla flotilla edmonia for her mother she said firmly jennifer for herself and  kezziah for miss kizzie he suggested  she was mighty good to you past times an thisll fetch her now she must be thinking of a boyname something special 
strong too up on his legs when he was an hour old  why dont you name him jesus christ hed had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been of course she wasnt herself right now but as her strength came back her spirits didnt seem to rise with it those elegant at home cards she sent out now she could wear her pretty clothes again and had the house all trimmed up hadnt brought many callers in two whole months 
miss kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married though youd have thought a namesake would have brought her round oh shed come to see them once left silver teething rings for all of the trips but when miss jen went over right away to return the call miss kiz couldnt have been very cordial for shed come back before she hardly had time to get there more and more these days shed been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her over to tillies and nicks his own old square frame box on posts chickens and cats and pups under the house everybody friendly inside making a todo over the babies dressed like dollies though he was glad she got on well with his young folks she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land too 
he didnt tell miss jen but she must have got word from the cook or nurse who of course knew those quinzaine nigs and she really took a fit if he ever did such a thing again shed die of shame  have a party an leave em out hon he suggested  a swell party send an invite to everbody but them those folks you met at the galt house the ones ive got to know in this new jockey club affair the whole dang neighborhood well have oystchers couple barl oystchersll fetch in a crowd any time 
he was downright worried about her but there was one more thing he could try zion was surprised when roys buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that eph showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town roy smiled he did have a nice smile took off his hat most politely told her to hop in and hed give her a lift to quinzaine her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he didnt notice it as she settled herself asked quickly how miss jenny and the babies were getting on he swung in through his own wide gateway 
shell relish the sight of a friendly face miss kiz wont care your comin will she  why of course not zion said uncomfortably  he must have forgiven me henrietta murmured to the room the absolution of doatys last will and testament was proof enough of that 
she found herself wishing an old wish that she had told doaty she was running away that she had left something more behind her than the loving sorry note and her best garnet pin perhaps doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel henrietta thought its extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us there had been more to know about hetty inevitably and most of it unfavorable adelia was the good one or if not always good less frequently tempted 
in winter in the city there had been the maneret school which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge there had been lessons in french from a small polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils there had been the dancing class miss craddock thin and tireless with her supervising wand and her everlasting onetwothree onetwothree there had been supper parties and teas fetes and little balls mama small and pretty and gay and papa enormously jocular enormously possessive the sun around which the blackwell planets revolved mama had died before the corruption of the family circle the interruption of charles 
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her but i would have gone anyway thought henrietta she had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice only at this moment perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in doatys bed she found herself examining how others might regard her perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice 
if adelia had felt about someone as henrietta felt about charles would she have run away with him impossible to imagine adelia feeling so about anyone a curious thought to end a curious night the birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music and light was beginning to creep across the room touching sill and door table and chair and all of doatys flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf before anything else she would go to doatys grave with flowers from doatys forgotten garden 
she closed her eyes remembering the small french cemetery enclosed by stone walls it had always seemed to rain there and even the grass was gray after the sad impatient moment waiting for comfort which could not come she slipped out of bed and went to the open window the garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness leaning out she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle one not quite come to bloom one just beyond it 
it was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things but doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme dun certain age feeling suddenly neat and subdued she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs rosa unbelievably was not yet up and about reassurance that rosa was human feeling protective toward this sleeping being henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot outside the garden the tame wilderness yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies sweet william scented stock and ladys bedstraw which she tied with long grasses and took back to show rosa who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing folly 
henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for doaty  rummaging in the dew said rosa coldly  go change your shoes before you turn around she sounded so exactly like doaty that henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home folly danced eager for whatever lay beyond the door 
the cemetery slumbered just behind it and the way lay through the village and close to the sea for the first time in thirty years henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity she smiled and bowed recalling the princessinacarriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child now some of the acknowledgments were cautious but all were interested an old man sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him gave her a more than reflective look as she passed the sap still plainly rising in his branches 
he cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time he then offered his own estimate of the weather which was unenthusiastic  summers been slow to come he said  im taking them to the cemetery said henrietta out of a vague feeling of hospitality  theyll be takin me next he said pleasantly but not so soons they plan 
its dryin myself out that does it  youd like to hear how i go about it  its nice of you henrietta said doubtfully he straightened himself soldierly against the wall and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text 
henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense  rests the tissues he said and pacifies the system my dad did it and he lived to a great age  dont remember do you she did suddenly through the link of memory with his father old titus who must have been in his nineties when henrietta ran away 
he had never spoken once to the awed sisters but his son had been friendly a big fellow of fifty or more a fishingboat captain and powerful like the sea it must be that son who sat before her now shriveled to half his size and half his senses she said gently of course i remember you  not so wells i remember you he said ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man 
 cant blame a man for leavin his wife he said quite cheerfully  left mine many a time only she never knew it man in a boat theres a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit he gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly  youd be the one to say he observed and she found herself liking his approval none too well but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were different since all actions had their own laws 
well she had not come back to great island to be understood praised or condemned she had come to make her peace with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow she started to move away just as a woman came out of the cottage a bigboned drabhaired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress she smiled vaguely at henrietta and spoke to the old man  youve not had your breakfast yet grandad 
he beat the air with his stick and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones  hes lowly today his granddaughter said wearily and bent to pick it up  hes got this idea about drying out  if it aint an idea she said how comes it you can drink beer but not water he looked piously to heaven and said beer dont affect the tissues none and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence 
 youll be visiting miss doaty maam the woman she must have been a tiny baby when hetty and delia had stood arm in arm watching great age grow small answered the nod with her own  god rest her soul she was a sweet one she put a strong hand under the old mans arm and lifted him up patiently with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old he mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength 
henrietta looked down at her bouquet still lively with its color and scent and set her feet on their journeys way again leaving the village street and crossing the first field folly dancing ahead of her at the edge of the field the wild rolling land took over dotted with fat round bushes like sheep they were covered with tiny white blossoms their scant roots clawing at the stony ground and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry the air was full of sounds too but placid ones a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky she felt mindless walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to doaty 
she sat down on the nearest fallen with age and gray with seadamp her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss the days sun was gathering its strength in gold and she wished she had brought her parasol if only to shade doatys flowers a small rockcarved angel watched her from a nearby tomb the only angel in the cemetery she remembered suddenly a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and adelia having dared each other had stolen out of their great safe house and come here hand in hand hoping and fearing ghosts the momoyama family had come from miyagi prefecture in the northeast of the main japanese island of honshu where there are still traces of the mysterious ainu strain 
they had white skins and blue eyes all their men were bearded and many of their women were beautiful a pitiful few of them are left now to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the american indians most of them have been assimilated but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honeyinthesun tint of the invaders from the south tommy momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions 
her nose was higher of bridge her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong her mouth soft and full was something for any man to dream about she had black eyes long and intriguingly tilted and the way she walked was melody she had been in japan just one week it was an alien land and she hated it intensely 
anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward there were no depressingly serious cases the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor sometimes the navy sent people back to the states to preserve a marriage but mental health as a rule was very high at present the doctors main concern was in seeing to it that japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore because the work involved setting off nerveshattering blasts at all hours tommy was interested in psychiatry because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients 
she had changed into a cocktail dress and the whole evening should have been before her but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck this was one of the navys crossroads you find them all around the world ships from the west coast rotated on sixmonth tours of duty with the seventh fleet and yokosuka was the seventh fleets principal port for maintenance upkeep and shore liberty sooner or later all the gray navy ships came in here if tommy sat long enough she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long beach 
she felt rather than saw the approach of the goodlooking young man he came through from the fleet bar which was stag with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried when he saw tommy sitting alone the tinkling sound stopped he was perhaps a trifle tipsy having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted and consequently out of practice he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in hong kong and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant 
there was a fiftyfifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different japan did something to a man and it wasnt just japan either because the same thing applied anywhere overseas it was as if foreign duty implied and excused license it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it and therefore why not then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different 
maybe you likee date with me  i dont believe i know you and i cant understand your quaint brand of english it was meant to be english wasnt it the nicelooking young officer fell back on his heels openmouthed and blushing at least he had the decency to blush she thought you see i thought i mean i really had no idea 
then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture and dropped into navy slang he muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy it hadnt been this way in college or in nurses training it wasnt this way in the hospital at san diego 
nobody had addressed her in broken english at any of those places nobody had suggested that she wasnt american there are spanish girls who look like tommy momoyama brunettes with a moorish hint of the orient in their faces there are beauties from the balkan states who are similarly endowed and back in the blessed united states they were regarded simply as pretty women now having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for tommy was being humiliated at every turn four little japanese waitresses were murdering the english language at the counter yuki kobayashi happened to be one of them 
for a steak sandwich or kohi futotsu two other japanese girls were sitting at the tables both quite pretty and well groomed one was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander the other was with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children she told herself rebelliously and with pride i am an american 
but she was learning that so long as she was in this country and wore civilian dress in the club there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken english there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese after coming to america her parents had spoken only english she had been sent to the wrong place for duty there was more to service in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward 
now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar it was terribly off key and poorly done and tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing but all at once she felt lonesome and putupon she finished her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion 
then after a while she went to her mirror she certainly looked japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young men and still they did not have to be so crude in their approach there was a letter to write to her mother and she tried to make its tone cheerful she promised that she would soon take a few days leave and visit the uncle she had never seen on the island of oyajima which was not very far from yokosuka 
tommy of course had never heard of a kotowaza or japanese proverb which says tanin yori miuchi and is literally translated as relatives are better than strangers actually this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water doc doolittles scheduled appearance at captains mast was a very unusual thing because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report but the beer hall riot in subic had been unusual too and walt perry was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didnt know 
the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief there had never been a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up he had come into the navy too young with the image of the funloving guns appleby before him the war found him much too early and its perils and especially its awful boredom were best forgotten in horseplay and elaborate practical jokes and even now doc had never found any stabilizing sobering influence he remained young at heart with an overdeveloped sense of humor 
he was doing thirty years and the navy would take care of him the job security enjoyed by doc doolittle and nearly all members of the armed forces is a wonderful thing actually all a man in uniform has to do is to get by he may not rise to the heights but he can get by and eventually be retired doc had been under restriction to the ship since the bustard left subic 
at yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of the base because walt perry being thoughtful knew that doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply base this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment and suited him quite well there were two things he wanted to do inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the naval base and visit an old shipmate a telephone line had been hooked up to connect the ship with the base exchange after supper doc called whitey gresham who was now a lieutenant and had a family 
 ill be there but ill walk doc said  ive got to run an errand on the way he threw a smart salute at the gangway went up the dock and turned down the wide street in front of the petty officers club how he wondered does one enjoy ones spare time he considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk 
perhaps golf with a fashionable companion but hed lost his clubs hadnt played in years there was swimming over at the riverside hotel but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog perhaps a packing trip into the sierras let his beard grow but that was too stark i could he thought take a long walk but where  you missed it buzzs voice said you should have gone over to the pagan room with us 
 hi buzz owen said  i went over to the willows and dropped two notes  tough buzz said listen were having a stag dinner over at the pagan room on friday imagine a stag dinner with toodle williams owen wanted to be pleasant because buzz worked the territory next to his but he hadnt come to reno for stag dinners 
buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest when owen was finally rid of him there was a timid rap at the door  im mrs gertrude parker a soft voice explained and id like to talk to you for a few minutes please ahah he thought a lush divorcee at last he was disappointed to find a nervous scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door 
 our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in alaska we call them laysisters and they go among the eskimos making friends and bringing the light theyre up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them  you see she said looking past him into the room where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light you and i cant understand the many hardships they have to undergo smug owen thought smug and sappy 
it gave her a lewd winking effect  have you ever tried to reason with an eskimo  they are a very difficult group of people  i dont know much about them owen admitted but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do people dont know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that 
that she was out for a touch was certain but when did she get to the pitch several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated trying to close the door a little and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice  how did you get by the desk  im sure the hotel doesnt know youre wandering around the corridors knocking on strangers doors and talking down eskimos  oh i just come once a week 
do you know these women go all through alaska and they dont have the proper facilities they travel in pairs as much as a hundredandfifty miles a day  do you have any idea how far i travel every day owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldnt help himself  thats hardly a christian approach she remonstrated 
those bibles and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses but they dont get top personnel our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics  god i take it plays no part in this she said waspishly  god doesnt have any appliance or cosmetics he said heatedly before he caught himself he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation 
 you know he said getting a grip on himself i think youre going to have to excuse me  i can imagine she said but what do you want to do about the laysisters  i have no card she said bitterly  you havent been listening to what ive been telling you 
she looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race she stood indecisively for a moment then walked down the hall it took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself he showered shaved dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail 
his lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony and there was a letter from the collector of internal revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last years exemptions he ate breakfast in a sullen mood but afterwards when he walked out onto virginia street he felt braced he looked off to the crest of the sierras still whitetopped the glisten of the truckee river made a wide spangle with any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot 
the tables were all spinning the dice rattling the bar crowded just to test himself he played roulette for quarters on his old combination five and seventeen and within an hour he had won surprisingly twenty dollars when the management brought around champagne the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach the golden calf was dimly lit with shaded neon there were more women than men in the place but he couldnt find a flowerpot 
the mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons who appeared much more animated than the gamblers the women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance while the men were stern but hopeful all of course except the donner party who were bent on starving to death  i wonder if they did eat each other at the end owen mused he sat down next to a heavilyupholstered blonde but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes 
she sat down and played two slots at once looking grim as if bested by mechanical devices and owen felt sorry for the laysisters depending on her support a driedup cowboy sat down next to him in the blondes place he was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables  what you need is a steady martingale the cowboy announced after watching owen play  you cant build on your hitandmiss fiveseventeen 
 i keep all these plays in this little black book and i watch over a twelvehour period to find out what numbers are repeating im always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack incidentally im pretty famous in these parts im called the wrangler dont you have to spend any time on your ranch im with the barh pushing a horse called sparky 
this sparky can rack and singlefoot and hes the fastest thing in washoe county i figure if i can get any kind of publicity campaign going ill land him on tv you know one of those favorite horses for some western hero i once trained a horse for hoot gibson but nothing like sparky hes a pinto and he photographs wonderfully five came up while owen was listening to the wrangler and he neglected to play a loss of ten dollars 
when he looked in the back mrs gertrude parker was marking keno cards he studied the pistol exhibition that hurrays featured as an added attraction he ogled a long redhead with green eyes but she was a shill with her money in front of her he had no great prejudice against shills the management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points 
he wondered if he might bag a tourist but they looked frightened of him he passed two brides both wearing orchids and they made him feel a little sad buzz had on a hawaiian shirt and was carrying some suntan oil and dark glasses he was shorter and fatter than owen who felt good standing next to him  were all going over to lake tahoe and try our luck at calneva buzz explained still instigating 
he started out as a stickman then became a pit boss until the club found him crossroading he was knocking down checks at faro  im allergic to tahoe owen explained  well okay buzz said owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot but he couldnt pyramid with any consecutive success 
a short platinum blonde in a bursting sunsuit addressed him she looked wellfed and prosperous but he didnt get the impression he was being propositioned the way hed been hoping  i havent had any luck since i was a baby  stake me she said and let me at those dice well get it in a hurry and get it out 
 if you go broke she said smiling up at him ill leave you  sounds like real love owen said  it sort of brings a lump to my throat  my names gisele the blonde said after she ordered a scotch my mother wanted to call me sylphide but it sounded too affected 
alexander said answer me properly spencer spencer was quiet for a moment longer then he said there is nothing i want to say captain naval procedure he thought had its moments of grim humor philip spencer had coldbloodedly planned the murder of his captain yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address during the morning hours it became clear that the arrest of spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the somers 
hostile glances were flashed at both alexander and gansevoort  what is the next step captain in your opinion who is this e andrews on the certain list he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot he saw the dangers not the glories of being identified as a mutineer 
there was a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished to see the captain heiser breathless and wildeyed brought the chilling news that the handspikes heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places  and also sir two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely an african knife and battleax are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley and green mckinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into spencers possession and that 
who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind him a glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away the aimless milling about of what had been a welltrained wellorganized crew struck alexander with horror he bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched too the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction 
i saw him myself and it was done after consultation with cromwell and it was clear that adrien was not mistaken for both small and cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till philip spencer had given the signal to obey then with disappointment evident upon their faces they moved to the work alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed their strategy was sound enough and he reasoned had been defeated only by philip spencers unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated 
spencers potential followers were openly sullen and morose missing muster without excuse expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons communicating with the three by glance and signal one of the missing handspikes came out of its hiding place after midshipman tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by seaman wilson tillotson had reported the man to gansevoort and an hour later with back turned had been attacked by wilson brandishing the weapon wilson shackled and snarling was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by green mckee and mckinley not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny 
three days had passed since spencers arrest and each day had brought new dangers new fears gansevoort said it requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely to have the greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed from actions aboard it is easy to guess that spencers boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate  well heiser ventured why dont we hold an investigation with questioning and 
 there is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners besides suppose we hold a court of inquiry then what then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the united states they will be punished but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order mr heiser does this sound like a truly workable plan to you do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now 
they are about to do so at any moment as it is all that is needed is for one man to feel selfconfident enough to take the lead as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from spencer we are going to be rushed we are going to be rushed and murdered  that is extravagant language mr wales 
 we are going to bring the somers into new york harbor safe and sound  of course i agree with the captain gansevoort said thoughtfully but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand he paused then added everything on a ship is a weapon implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands 
 under arms day and night watch and watch about those of us present the perry brothers deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the somers a great deal of labor we have as well for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed and when he was alone again in the cabin alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept for he knew full well what must be done what in the end would be done with all his heart he had loved the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navys implacable laws 
he who had tried so hard who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer it came to him as he wept there aboard the somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven it was given or it was not given one did ones best and if fortune smiled there was a reward one did ones best and if fortune frowned an eighteenyearold boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard ones ship 
god knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired for it had not been with an egotists rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist it was for love that he had served the navy to have someday that love returned was what he had lived for yes he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price 
sternfaced he inspected the prisoners satisfying himself that they were clean well fed and comfortable within reason the prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger only cromwell the giant boatswain was mildmannered and respectful he said captain may i speak please captain i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship 
 you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt  i cannot speak for others sir but i am innocent he leaned closer to alexander squinting up at him from the deck  surely captain you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything  no cromwell i did not find your name 
he said cromwell is telling you the truth the calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend cromwell alexander knew spencer too well to think him naive or thickskulled and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognized a kinship with spencer here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable 
he expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune the redhaired captain towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer this tragic lad had forged his own shackles but he could not have done so could not have found the way had fortune favored him and because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the redhaired captain they would be each others undoing 
 i tell you he is innocent  and do you think there is a reason why i should accept your word i have nothing to gain by defending cromwell  nothing to lose either spencer  thats true spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation 
 i am innocent captain cromwell said again  before god captain i am innocent and though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth still it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell no action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen prior to their knowing the significance of the greek paper had seen it in cromwells hands while spencer whispered explanations  i thought midshipman rogers had told alexander that spencer was teaching him geometry 
this was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized some of these apprentices were in physical strength already men and doubtless a percentage of them were spencers followers rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the torah a young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides he wore a long doublebreasted coat of a heavy material dark trousers and black boots with buckles 
with his head erect he approached not glancing at us and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead he had a pinkishwhite complexion a small straight nose a short black beard and tightly curled paot i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms the girls in the market place wore longsleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings i turned and watched him stride down the center of the road 
rachel had seen me watching the young man  when your mother was here he must have been a young boy like the ones you will see now i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside rachel she led me into a twisting side alley 
rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings we entered one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor an old man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat baggy trousers and a black skullcap greeted us he nodded clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch and flicked glances at me i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were barearmed but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor 
little boys crowded together on long wooden benches and in the center of the room sat the teacher his black beard dripped down over the front of his coat one white hand poised a stick above his desk he turned his surly halfclosed eyes toward us stared for a second then shouted in yiddish one two three the little boys shrilled out a yiddish translation or interpretation of the five books of moses which they had previously chanted in hebrew 
each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and greatgrandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of europe they had large bright eyes the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces they bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher since they did not glance curiously at us once i guessed that there was a penalty for distraction the teacher plunged the children into a new portion this time in hebrew rapping the stick incessantly 
his tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders in the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap i stared at him for a long time my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago 
the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake i could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair his body pitched back and forth on the bench i shuddered and backed out of the room rachel followed looked at me and clucked with her tongue 
i said how long do they keep that up  except for shabbat when they are praying all day they had turned numb and prickly in the classroom the old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps he glanced down into his beard and muttered something in yiddish 
i reached into the pocket of my skirt fingered ten pruta and dropped the coin then i picked it up again and handed it to the old man  most of our sabras think its horrible when we were fighting a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass they said that we must not fight but wait for the messiah 
you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal you had to know also that you were going to fail all of it might have been heroic but they had done it in the wrong place she said sometimes i think they are keeping religion for us while we play around she wished to change much for the children here 
but when she saw the children you have just visited she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country in the kibbutzim she was a strange woman your mother when she loved it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted for many immigrants for many children the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your mother 
and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people it was an impulse when she was here in mea shearim i was with her that led her to stay in israel your mother wanted to bring children to israel so that they could leave their ghettos here they did not need to be in ghettos if she could not take the children out of this section at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms 
i said quietly gaining nerve ready to ask any question at all no matter how intimate ready to be rebuffed then why did she leave israel id like to know that very much rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace the soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones she pursed her lips then clamped them together so tightly that i thought she was angry with me 
but she had to go out and hurt herself he helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted there was a refugee who was able to come here because of her at first i thought they were relatives of your mother but it was not so this refugee was a middleaged man a big handsome man with a strut to his walk as i have never before seen 
often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of europe all his family was dead except for his son your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off and she would send him home to his son he loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him 
a few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed she ran from a little group of us she went to the father and found he had hanged himself then she continued with energy i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father no one saw her except the man reuveni 
she said reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee he complained to me once that i must talk to her when i did she shrugged her shoulders and said that reuveni wanted her to marry him i asked her if she would and she said she would not he had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him 
and she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to reuveni and accepted his proposal he shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldnt understand why she had upset herself but now he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her he would never let her harm herself again for one whole week he never let her stay alone 
reuveni took her with him wherever he went he did not let her talk to people he did not let her choose her own food she was limp and beaten from her loss  and ill take you with me 
 did i see him about to swing low in a chariot or maybe poling up the south fork of the forked deer river braving the wastes dumped in it maybe i saw him on a barge with a gang of ethiopians poling it and the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when gratt went out for ice the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened and gratt shafer would be in memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would just like everybody knew all along 
just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen or you could hope the parachute wouldnt open just so you could say you saw it not open not because you meant any harm to starkey poe in his suit of red underwear but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice i think im pregnant or you could wish your daddy would really do it kill gratt shafer like he said when you all the time all along could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you wont tell a combination like ham and eggs rape her and kill her and that is being an old maid too it is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull 
he can even be a mildvoiced littletown guy with bigtown ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even houdini couldnt figure out how it is unlocked and he can be on the way to memphis your gratt shafer can and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him really want him dead because if you cant then nobody else can either nobody else can have him for you dont share him not even with god even if thats all the promise he ever gave or ever will give the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie 
and in a way the promise works out true for whether he wants you or not you go with him in your heart you feel where he is and what he sees and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman the one that never could love him the way you do the one who got him because she didnt particularly give a damn whether she got him or didnt and you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didnt get him and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy the chump who begged you to marry him the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldnt afford and the tooshiny shoes you think did he feel that way about me it comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldnt have gratt shafer 
it dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you he was a man and that because gratt shafer was making you miserable you were passing it down to him to gratt shafers substitute that other guy and you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to st louis where he got to be a big unhappy success you wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldnt be happy yourself to give somebody else the one they wanted to give them you  damn the world she thought 
homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments the bands were impatient but they were the only ones the others the ones in the stands were spellbound for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in new york city it was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing he was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the united states some day 
if a man was good if he was going to be governor you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too it was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it you laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your arm he hit the theme about dying to defend your country and you were ready to do it right then without a second thought 
she glanced at the man nodding beside her a man with weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks with powdery pale eyes reflecting all the droughts he had seen reflecting the sky and the drought which must follow now in august yes with eyes predicting the drought and here it was only june only festival time again and thoughts of gratt shafer would not leave her  i should have stayed at the store she thought back at the factorytoyou with the other old maids back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirtyfour which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down there was no lock because herman didnt allow a lock a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping 
she could not count the times herman had rapped on the door just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might someday break away the pipe connections from the wall the two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching whicheverthehell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot and the hours were sixthirty in the morning until eleven at night on saturdays and during sales and there were no chairs and you couldnt smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor among us we three handled quite a few small commissions from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs each of us had his own specialty besides 
he also drew precise crisp spots which he sold to various literary and artistic journals the new yorker for instance or esquire i did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver the book could be the brothers karamazov but it would still have the same jacket illustration i remember once i did a jacket for magpie press the book was a fine historical novel about edward # and i did a week of research to get the details just right the fifteenthcentury armor furnishings clothes 
mckenzie the art editor took one look at my finished sketch and said nothing doing rufus in the first place its static in the second place it doesnt look authentic and in the third place it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place youve got six colors there including gold i said mr mckenzie it is as authentic as careful research can make it 
they know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like little lord fauntleroy and only the villains had beards and girls couldnt have dressed like that it isnt transparent enough in the end i did the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in the doorway only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy gave him a sword instead of a pistol and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie as for donald he actually sold paintings we all painted in our spare time and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it 
he had style a real inner vision of his very own it was strange stuff it reminded me of the pictures of a child but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults there was the freshness of color the freedom of perception the lack of selfconsciousness but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye we used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted it may have been true for all i know because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles but it didnt prevent the paintings from being exciting 
he would look right through you while you were talking to him and if you said for christs sake donald youve got prussian blue all over your shirt he would smile and nod and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well mrs monmouth thought of him as her discovery and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting it was all gravy and donald didnt need much to live on we shared the expenses of the studio and we all lived within walking distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or another attending the life class was my idea or rather askingtons idea but i was ripe for it and the other two wouldnt have gone if i hadnt talked them into it 
it wasnt just the pressure of work although that was the excuse i often used even to myself it was the kind of work i was doing the quality of the ambition it awoke in me that kept me from painting i kept saying if i could just build up a reputation for myself make some real money get to be well known as an illustrator like peter askington for instance then i could take some time off and paint askington was a kind of goal i set myself i had admired him long before i talked to him 
the night we first met at one of mrs monmouths giant parties he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink viyella shirt instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade this set his tone richness of texture and color and another kind of richness as well for his clothing and decorations would have paid the brushoffs rent for a year he was fifteen years older than i fortyfour but full of spring and sparkle he didnt look like what i thought of as an old man and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger 
you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month life had included him in its modern american artists series and had photographed him at his studio in the east sixties the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have velasquez in it painting the royalty of spain we went into mrs monmouths library which had low bookshelves all along the walls and above them a modigliani portrait a jackson pollock twelve feet long and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background that looked like an inscription from a martian tomb the fireplace had tiles made for mrs monmouth by picasso himself 
in the course of our talk askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying  no i take classes with different people he said  i dont think ive reached the point yet where i can say i know everything i ought to know about the craft besides its important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters as durer went to italy to meet bellini and mantegna he made a circle with his thumb and fingers 
it doesnt embrace only the artist alone before his easel it is as large as all of art interdependent varied multitudinous he threw his arms wide his face shining  the artist is like a fragment of a mosaic no he is more than that a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic one of these days im going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything thats being painted these days from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism and then youll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other 
ah what a title for the exhibition the eye is all just listening to him made me feel intelligent  im studying anatomy with burns he replied he teaches at the manhattan school of art i had studied with burns ten years before during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me along with the fivehundreddollar prize for my paintings of bums on hudson street 
 im also studying enameling with hajime iijima he went on and twice a week i go to a life class taught by pendleton  my god is he still alive i went to a retrospective of his work when i was eighteen and i thought he was a contemporary of cezannes still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful canvases of mountains and farms he even makes the city look like one of thoreaus hangouts 
 yes it sounds great i said but suppose you dont think of yourself as an impressionist painter  youre missing the point he said and thats the trouble with so many artists today they sit alone in their rooms and try to paint and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life thats one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation 
he was an artisan a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did he filled a real need showing society what it looked like turning it inside out portraying its wars and its leaders its ugliness and its beauties reflecting its profound religious impulses he was a propagandist they werent afraid of the word then satirist nature lover philosopher scientist what you will a member of every party and of no party we hold safe little jobs illustrating toothpaste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity what we need is to get back to the group to learning and apprenticeship to the cafe and the school 
it was an awkward hour but i didnt have to punch any time clock and it only meant that sometimes i had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job after a short time both george and donald joined the class with me so they wouldnt feel lonely and we used to hang a sign on the door of the brushoff reading out to work it was mostly for the benefit of the mailman because hardly anybody else ever visited us  stimulating was the word for it i dont know that it was always as rewarding as i had expected it to be 
i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars actually there was a lot of force in him which is why i kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week such a little thing to start with the car registration  ida where is the car license  i cant find it in the glove compartment 
 why should via have it had she forgotten she had signed the car away that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children  i drive my own car by courtesy of via  im sure shed turn it over to you if youd rather she looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud 
walter was giving me checks for my pay the household bills had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind  what a fool ive been she said quietly  i knew all this but i paid no attention i dont even own the house im standing in 
 it narrows down down down and finally there is no way out if i am not to be mrs salter i am nothing i suppose i should have paid attention to that halfmurmured remark but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in i love you i hate you i feel like killing you and myself and in the same sequence i love you i think youre the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living i made a lemon sponge a light dessert roasted a chicken parboiled some frozen vegetables so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend 
 i have these appointments in town for saturday and ill probably spend sunday with dolly or the thaxters at last i thought shes recovering her spirits with this movietobe in london and new faces about her there she would soon be a more tranquil a wiser person all the better for her stay out here i felt more cheerful as if i had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life 
in the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on i did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the fog i assumed mrs salter had done the same before she left for town i did my shopping had my dentist appointment and from there i went to the womens lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual christmas bazaar so that dusk was beginning to gather when i drove home in the late afternoon why when i drove down to church didnt it speak to me seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove absent itself unsee 
even at a cars length i could sense that something was wrong and so i followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house dolly engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us she screamed and both women ran up to the house and i followed the search began in all the rooms running upstairs down opening closets talking exclaiming in rushes and gasps everything was as i had left it the night before last her portfolio and bag for town her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out only her mink coat was missing 
it was dolly and mrs thaxter who were calling via everybody and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me and after i brought them sandwiches and coffee i had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait sitting in the kitchen i recalled every word mrs salter said that could have been a sign to me  if i am not to be mrs salter then i am nothing 
and then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to rome i had heard her boast over and over again on the boat people liked me for myself i had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage just to check the last night i had called but the line was always busy and it reassured me i assumed it was one of those hourlong conversations with dolly or constance she comfortable in bed but it seemed not from what they were saying 
hanging on and on past any mans patience some final stab of conclusion she was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff i tried to believe that what must have happened was that restless disturbed by this telephone call or whatever she walked out in the night as she had a habit of doing sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff its so romantic up there she used to say with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night so poetic 
but i didnt really think it was as simple as that nor did anyone else when a fisherman brought her up in his arms still small as if she were a child asleep i began to shudder with a terrible excitement almost triumphant that i still cannot account for was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks that at last the vigilance the will gives way or what was it that before via sonny walter and all i began almost to dance with shuddering and cry out i knew shed do it 
at the same time that i thought i understood her at long last and pitied her underneath this knowing had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate an enduring envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry was that what had given way in me even now i am appalled at how little anyone knows of what they really are it is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged me from the family i considered my very own but there it hangs a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other at the time i was filled with selfpity at this separation but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that outcry 
it is not their avoidance that rankles it is when i meet someone who was a close friend of the family and therefore of mine and they nod to me so coolly and walk away that it hurts i could tell them but no one ever asked why i had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body no i forget mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised mrs salter to return to the country 
 why put such a high value on being top dog it was coarse almost insulting this harsh appraisal and she has never come to see me since but suppose she had not taken mrs mathias advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns dispossessed of love hanging on to makeshifts and altogether and finally arid if she chose and in that final decision discarded what above all all of us value life itself must she not have risen to her fullest height and transcending her murky self felt at last the passion of a great moral decision if they say i could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of selfexamination her search into herself and its conclusions 
she was finally at rest in truth of her own proud free choice at rest with my darling ellen the first mrs salter the funeral service was in the house the methodist minister how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words and the rain drumming incessantly in accompaniment seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed then via called to say they had decided to cremate her as they had ellen the thought leaped to my mind and did i want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the sheaf of white roses i had ordered 
via was in the parking lot when i went outside together we waited in her car until the hearse moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey by the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the chapellike auditorium with its discreet symbols of religious faiths again i felt impelled to kneel and reached back and pulled via down something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing 
a nice bachelor apartment in a place called the lancaster arms  uhhu she said hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid  and then i had another place farther downtown i used as a studio  im not a man who has many close intimate friends carla he said wanting her to know all about him  oh id drink with newspaper people 
but i think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with pausing he waited for her to turn to ask a question she showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home and it hurt him a little  well what about you carla  did you make friends easily 
 i guess so she said taking a kleenex from her purse when she had wiped some of the lipstick from her mouth she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror  are your people still alive he asked trying to touch a part of her life alberto hadnt discussed so he could have something of her for himself 
 you seem to have read so much you have a natural gift for words he added trying to flatter her vanity  you must have been good at history at school where did you go to school  dont you know all about me by this time you know something more about me every day dont you 
why are you trying to worry me  im not trying to worry you the cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor and he got up and picked up one then another hoping she would notice what he was doing at home he had been a clean orderly man and now he had to hide his annoyance was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance 
he straightened up ready to vent his exasperation then grew afraid if he dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her and without the respect he might lose his view of her too nothing at all he said quietly  are those the only shoes you have sam  whats the matter with them 
 sam no one around here wears such heavy soles  maybe i could he said surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him  ill get an elegant pair of thinsoled italian shoes tomorrow carla  and i dont know why you want to go on wearing that outfit she said making a face  whats the matter with it 
cant you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged  i dont mind at all he said delighted with her attention changing his clothes he put on his darkblue flannel suit and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good but it was a hopeful sign he told himself she no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in parioli 
they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower via veneto then they went to the farnese gardens she had some amusing scandal about the farneses in the old days  theres a church you should see she said and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at santa maria he had to keep a straight face not letting on he had been there with alberto he let her tell him all about the church 
when they got home at midnight she was tired out and in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing he had never heard so many bells and as he lay there listening he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish steps it was a good thing that she clung to her religion he thought she might like to take him to st peters 
you could take me to st peters  come on youll be late  i think ill sleep in this morning she said drowsily and as she snuggled against him he wondered if she ever went to church why did he want her to go to church he wondered probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security 
she would have been better off if she had stuck to her bible as for himself he just didnt have the temperament for it from the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know then he thought of those old testament figures on the ceiling of the sistine chapel could he honestly believe it would be good for carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now 
it was too bad he wasnt a catholic himself or a protestant or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists or a strict orthodox communist what was the matter with him that they all wearied him it was the times he was sure all the ideologies changing from day to day right under his eyes so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom 
a half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the ferraros hearing them hurrying down the stairs would think they were going to a late mass it seemed to him that if the ferraros felt sure of them could place them it would help him to feel more sure of himself with carla  since were having coffee with them this afternoon he said i think ill ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us and he waited for her to say oh no i can do it sam  im not good at that kind of thing 
lets be fine superior people of great dignity he said as if he were joking  if you find it necessary sam go ahead she said turning on the stair her words remained with him worrying him for hours he didnt know how she would behave with other people when they walked into the ferraro apartment the old lady bowing and smiling said softly 
her little brown face wrinkled up her brown eyes gleamed and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things agnese smiling too said ello and then more slowly i am happy and they sat down and began their little coffee party the ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee acting only as interpreter carla her hands folded on her lap was utterly impersonal 
watching her he felt like a spectator at a tennis game with the ball being bounced back and forth signora ferraro bobbing her head encouragingly asked sam about canada having a special interest the old woman had a nephew from north italy a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment and who had migrated to canada to work on the railway for a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar did many of sams countrymen live in boxcars in the bush 
regretfully sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars just the same the old woman said she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country and sam thanked her and hoped he might meet her nephew back home and asked her if she had any further news of the pope a very great pope this one the old woman explained her black eyes sparkling it was said that he had had a vision 
agnese had been sitting quietly listening with the serenity of the unaware now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes the holy father would die soon she said to carla so she could translate for sam although he had a brilliant doctor a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world yes the pope could die and quickly be made a saint no he was indeed a saint now 
there was a certain discontent among the cardinals the pope in the splendor of his great intellect had neglected them a little there would be changes made and signor raymond should understand that when the pope died it was like the end of a regime in rome jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent indeed he did sam said solemnly trying to get carlas eye 
devout orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in brooklyn or malta or ireland but carlas eyes were on agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness and carla watching in wonder turned to sam its like a flame i guess she said in a dreamy tone but one night dookiyoon moved in the direction of the womens lodge where shades of night had gone to purify herself 
he saw her emerge suddenly coming in her unhesitant fashion her back stiff her head erect facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach in her dark scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination afraid of nothing not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding seeing her come he caught his breath feeling his heart bounce in him and turned away afraid now even he wanting her afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit feared the evil presences in her metabolism more his breath caught and trembling he closed his eyes and stumbled off 
he cried out to her his back turned then he fled not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly her neck tall as she looked in his direction and continued on her way toward the end of the camp elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small curious clusters early spring came from her bed from beside her halfdrunk husband walitzee and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion the sound of hushed voices 
when at last she could suffer the insult no longer nor face the girls scorn she said in a voice overloud go back where you can bring no harm or i will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame but the girl said only tell him i am here that i have come and it was not pile of clouds she meant but now with real anger at last something proud and indignant early spring stood like a she wolf before her den and cried i will not shriek at you 
and unsheathing the knife she used for curing hides she stepped away from the lodge holding the knife at her side  you bring only wickedness she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal speaking in a low voice of loathing she went up to the girl who stood with the same upright scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife  go take helsqiyokom your evil spirit to the young boys the woman said  they do not have to face battle 
they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl the sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs they were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought but she did not move taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly pile of clouds came howling among them swinging a great bullhide whip  go back to your lodges 
he made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming some tripping over themselves in their flight and early spring seized the whip and said  if you must flog someone let it be her your daughter drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband but the old man turned on her jerking the whip from her hand 
keep him back if you must tell me what to do i will be the one to confront my daughter not the wife of him who leads her to sin she retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where walitzee stirred mumbling sitting up in a half stupor to say i thought i dreamed of wolves fighting but she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from tuhulhulzote 
do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain he sank back sighing and was soon asleep again outside the old man beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore went to her and twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms and shoving her against a spruce her back to him he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged as dark and motionless as ever her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face she said to him her father how was i begotten in pain or joy 
they all know your foolish name she stared at the pale tracings on the tree hearing her breath refracted from it her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark she felt the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables words which had no meaning like unnnt the sounds of an animal in rage and despair suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high quavering voice 
move from the line or i will settle the whip on you do you hear the anger of the whips whine turning the girl saw dookiyoon standing between his narrow shoulders unbent his arms hanging long and resigned he said let me take her blows for there are demons in me too then without knowing why she found herself running from them fleeing wildly through the trees dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry 
he shouted like a hoarse old mastiff his hair stiff and bristling he ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies walking in circles in and out of his living place drinking stolen whisky in great gasping draughts until finally incoherent and sick he fell into his own oblivion he amused the young men who had been silent long enough but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics now they moved rubbing their flesh alive again disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them 
it was they who held the future in their hands they went into the sun together and paraded grandly in their war clothes painting their faces with the sacred attis dug far off in the cave of skeletons they danced the paxam wildly at night the war dance and dipped their arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers firing their few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal walitzee was among them and sarpsis and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing and a very young one swan necklace tried to emulate them and followed timidly 
he would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction because something had boiled over in his fermenting juices all the young men alokut among them challenged them in matched racing they raced and maneuvered for war swinging their horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry at times they would ride frenziedly through the camp letting the women see their courage how handsome they were in their regalia then again they would stand in circles making other preparations 
walitzee whitened his leggings with clay knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees he saw himself in a superior reflection and he was as a speeding arrow from the taut bow hurtling with a mad grace his maleness shining and scented with meadow rue he was always aware of the womens eyes which followed him admiring him and the suspicious envenomed eyes of pile of clouds and those of early spring haunted and now full of hurt and envy 
he and sarpsis planned a great parade with the young men they would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance they would ride with streaming amulets their colors ripening in the sun shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young mens blood shifting then into the full heat and outcry which ran with their hearts they mounted their horses and rode off into the hills 
the sound rose on the other side of the hills vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad disheveled hoofs of the appaloosas horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge standing then with the others peering into the sun he saw the bright multicolored legion their hair flying like dark banners only the thunder the roll of drums the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying them they leaned into the wind and seemed like one thousandlegged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted ejaculated their grotesque cry of war she was moving through a screen of hemlocks in among the white birch and maples 
she had never been here at this hour she felt as if some dark totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm but she found the path she always used the stubs of branches she had broken those she had pushed aside and she walked easily now and more slowly until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her if i ever committed suicide she thought i would dive straight down from here and no one would find me for days 
she jumped out onto the flat expanse of rock and seating herself shook her shortcut brown hair and tilted her chin far upward the reedy music of the frogs had faded but presently it began again growing in volume until it was vibrant julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees only only her thoughts were a little strange perhaps it was because it was so late and because she had no business to be here now 
 hello julie how are you and then off he went so casually to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a lowercut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him i wish he was with me now she thought and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment i wish i were older or younger julia bentley thought george rawlings remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night millie in a white robe standing like a ghost at the threshold 
it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday morning he would not be indebted to sam below him as if at the end of some remote tunnel he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner they had left both of his eyes uncovered 
he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands a fearful pain had come from his head as if the water were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them and there were his shoes thank god but his shirt was one terrible mess he shivered and then tore away the bloodsoaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf sam would be amazed to find him gone 
he found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness alex poldowski in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman at least alex had told him he wasnt dying perhaps george rawlings would be better off dead too early for a vacuum cleaner but probably sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs 
this was some freak two strands of adhesive tape across his nose like ugly roots from the mass of gauze suddenly moist over his cheekbones the surface however was perfectly white he was supposed to be in court this afternoon at city hall hed have to think but the main thing the imperative necessity was to leave before sam bentley was up and about and before millie detained him with sympathy a plane up in the sky above the clouds and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away 
the voice issued from the cavern of the hall below for a moment he felt like a thief discovered then julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room you shouldnt be up should you  i i was just leaving here julie 
she seemed overly tall her brow knitted in concern  well at least you wont have to do that she was saying  im going back to school she answered but have you told mother you were going i just dont want anyone disturbed julie 
her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight  well wont you come in then have a cup of coffee or something she asked in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated considerate and yet perhaps partly scornful he tried to see her face more clearly  no nothing at all he said after a moments hesitation 
he leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids  as a great favor julie he said please dont mention youve seen me  ill call your mother as soon as i get home  all right she was staring at him he could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages 
i wouldnt have the strength to answer he thought he saw the suitcase which julia was holding  ill take that julie for you he could hardly believe he was getting in pietro was gazing at him in an insolent disdainful fashion 
to the manner born odd to have such a thought at a time like this he had never felt particularly close to her carrie seemed more affectionate but obviously julia had respected his request  i wish i didnt have to go back to school she said and then i wish you lived in new york  i wish i did he responded 
 forget we ever knew what  oh just sort of everything in general she said nothing until pietro had slackened their pace  i know you feel badly but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say im supposed to joke about things arent i 
he could see the stone building where he lived  are you positive youll be all right by yourself as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it he should have discovered a more tender farewell someone shouted at him well 
he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it in the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp just one or two swallows he told himself enough to lessen some of the pain tell sam not to worry about the car no please no visit today ill be asleep 
 joan did i wake you  yes i thought youd probably be up happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night unfortunately it turned out to be me but i wouldnt quite put it that way to the boss oh hell no im not in a hospital 
but i thought maybe tony elliott could pinchhit for me hell understand you might give him sort of a tactful nudge i wouldnt want to ask for a postponement its really just a routine thing no darling id rather you didnt come out a smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape 
a strange relationship between joan fulbright and himself she lived alone in the older part of the city in one of those renovated houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed she had two tiny rooms on the second floor she was a clever girl a most efficient secretary she let him come and go as he pleased or as it pleased her 
yet if he said make an excuse yourself come out here today she would have been on the next train and similarly if she had been in need he would have gone to her  they make us conformists look good  thats a peculiar way to think it wasnt just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers of course it was jims little sister myra the unreliable irresponsible forever flyaway myra 
 come come jim said jollying lucy a little upstairs busy feet showering like raindrops pattered around her room susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days but even at seven she was a prudent soul she always packed for a lifetime just in case every doll in the house must be going with her 
as he looked at her it registered anxiety  myra wanted me to thank you for taking cathy itll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in paris but even so she wants you to know that shes awfully grateful jim had put the thanks in his sisters mouth  darling she said and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend 
remember what happened the last time leaving cathy with them myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly brief visit but she had stayed all winter and cathy had stayed all winter too with them lucy suspected that myra would never have come home if gregg myras husband hadnt gone out to fetch her  that was an awfully long two weeks 
 but she promised this will be different he said at last  youve got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there shell get a home for herself and cathy in no time on the defensive he added i wish youd think what it must be like for her to be without greg to be a new widow a young widow lucy had an idea that myra loved it and not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down 
remembering that succession of disasters she now considered cathy an ominous childcloud on her horizon the youngster drew her troubled her depths whenever lucy saw her she tried without noise or fuss to give her the warmth she had never had from myra but cathy was myras responsibility not hers  i wouldnt even be surprised she said unhappily if myra tried to leave her with us forever 
lucy knew her too well to find it impossible  thats a horrible thing to accuse her of jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said he too had seen the looming specter of a forevercathy he went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up fiercely susan  dont yell at susan lucy said 
their arms around each other they had been talking of the present and the future their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm as steeped in light as the air around them then from within the still sleeping house the telephone had rung myra with her news was on the other end of the line jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her 
 there isnt a chance of myras letting anything like that happen but they werent just friends lucy thought they were husband and wife and myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage the only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless selfish sister of his  well at last she said because susan was clattering down the stairs 
her arms were straining with a burden of dolls  do you need that big bundle his voice had sharp edges as though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief to her each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart 
 your father didnt mean it susan she gave jim a quick shapeup look of warning  shell take every one of them jim groaned but he lifted susans suitcase and said in a gentler tone sure the entire thousand and when you get back from grandmas cathy will be here to play with you 
and at this point lucy thought there should be a lecture on little cousins sharing dolls but she could sympathize with susan there ought to be a limit to sharing too that was one more reason she didnt look forward to cathys visit short or long the last one had been a lilliputian war she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had 
when the car with susans hands waving wildly from the rear window disappeared down the driveway lucy stood looking after its pale dust the day was brilliant around her flowerscented crisp with breeze yet her inner turmoil darkened it she had let jim go with a chilly goodby a chillier kiss she was sorry and angry at herself because never in their life together had she done that she turned and began to walk toward the house 
its mate must be at home silently guarding their nest she had better stay there lucy thought the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels she said to herself abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds she had a day of things to do 
she wondered with a baffled feeling of helplessness as long as the unscrupulous myra chose for a moment her mind returned again to the strange flying world of birds and she said to herself it isnt only birds that dump their children in other peoples nests in the sunshine of late afternoon lucy stood looking at the ready guest room 
a row of little hangers waited for a childs clothes in the neatly empty closet since myra had always put most of gregs money on her own back lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed the closet was faintly fragrant with lavender and as lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind like a lavender ghost gregs house on the day he was buried and the child pale silent baffled watching the funeral guests with panicky eyes many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her out in the hall the upstairs phone shrilled and the small ghost vanished 
 websterville junction calling she said  i just thought id let you know myra dropped cathy this morning and jim picked cathy up and left susan a few hours ago id have phoned sooner but ive been busy for mother to be able to call susan must be napping now surrounded by her multitude of dolls 
she relaxed a little and some of the tension went out of her you could think yourself as grown up as methuselah yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic but myra was the merriest widow i ever saw on her way to the airport on her way to paris you bet lucy said to herself  ive been fixing up the guest room for cathy 
 just for a couple of weeks till myra finds a place for them  well this time there was a long silence while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life puzzled lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper she was not usually given to mysterious silences was she thinking along the same lines lucy was that it was quite possible cathy might be left with her for good 
once the soft pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted suddenly seekingly lucy asked mother do you know something i dont know again there was that curious pause and then her mother said i guess i do just before myra left she was saying goodby to cathy and she didnt realize i was near she hesitated as though hunting over words and ways of putting them 
then she jumped to her feet the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake  then it was no bogey she had dreamed up myra had no intention whatever of sending for cathy in two weeks for a moment anger darkened the hallway about her and when she found her voice anger thickened it then if myra does nothing about fetching her ill pack her right back to her mother if i have to take her myself 
for lucy the days nagging toandfro had come to an abrupt end as she hung up she saw through the halls open window the purpleblack flying of the cowbirds wings and heard their grotesque singing shes not going to get away with it cathy is tired lucy thought watching them come slowly up the path she trudged along slowly both hands clutching a tired teddy bear 
unlike susan she was traveling light the worn teddy bear a tiny suitcase that jim carried and the clothes she wore were all she had lucy glancing at the miniature case knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays they would have to buy things for her unimpressed the dog plopped on the sand 
the swirling sand made quints limp more pronounced they walked slowly past the sherbetcolored cottages eleven lemon nine mint seven orange around the curve to a deserted stand with an eats sign jiggling in the wind nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the waters edge his rock was to the right of a vshaped inlet a big brown lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here 
here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe he was a knight of the round table sir quintus the brave slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses  one good thing about a suit of armor his leg wouldnt show  he was the first astronaut on the moon chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature he was six feet one like his father with big hands and a hairy chest a man the weak and persecuted would turn to 
a dark bathroom can be pretty scary and hed creep back to bed proud of himself thinking tomorrow for sure ill go down to the rock and keep my promise to dad it happened two weeks ago the night before his father left on a business trip to south america every piece of the nightmare was clear in place and when he woke up his father was saying stop screaming quint he could remember the feel of his fathers big hands the thump of his fathers heart sending out signals regular like radar 
look i can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck dr fortman says swimming would help your leg he says youre limping more than you need to in the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out when you get back ill probly be swimming better than victoria 
she called him stuckup thats why nobody plays with you mister stuckup or what was worse she prayed for him out loud at bedtime please lord gord please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised strength began to zip up and down his chest he unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg he wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks 
 aw shut up he said he stood on the rock a skinny dignified boy surrounded by the ocean the wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there bleeding wedged between the rocks and the waves and shivering with shame he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water  watch it big shot a hoarse voice yelled back 
she wore a bathing suit like his mothers no straps on the shouders  ever hear of squatters rights they started with the kansasnebraska bill of eighteen  mister big britches arent you  then why dont you stop squinting 
 you shouldnt smoke so much he said unconsciously imitating victorias holierthanthou voice not having said hell before he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum  sometimes eleven fourteen a day  if i was your mama id wop your tail off she seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace 
 why dont you paint it red and white like a barber pole  because maybe i wont have to wear it always dr fortman says if i exercise my leg more maybe i can use a cane when im big she spouted a mouthful of water into the air someones walking past you want to stop him zoooop snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane 
hey will you look at that maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail  part collie part wirehaired terrier  holy mackerel thats the most unique dog i ever saw she said firmly  his real names dimaggio only we call him maggie because he has to take tranquilizers 
he would have told her but victoria was yodeling come home or ill come find you even though this is my rock you can use it sometimes they met next morning and all the mornings thereafter same time early before the fog burned off because she didnt like the sun 
 you going to marry the king hes got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork personally i prefer straight hair like yours but as they say on the continent what can one do  name one i been there japan she said smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks 
near galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night as for dancing holy mackerel he ought to see the gypsies in jerez they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them she made better pictures than any book hed read but he didnt say so artfully as the days went by he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the navy cross in the korean war 
that he personally had an iq of ### and was currently reading the mushr to ozon volume of the encyclopedia she skipped a piece of water at him and laughed a funny hoarse laugh he liked to hear nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as sabella  what did one tonsil say to the other tonsil lets get dressed up the doctors taking us out tonight 
 encouraged by her giggles he imitated maggie who was crazy about ham he described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries cooling on the porch he snuck up on the ham like maggie gumming it with soft stumpy teeth then panting with thirst lapping up the water in the lagoon swelling up like a balloon staggering home to be sick while his mother said that does it  say youre quite a comic sabella said admiringly  ever thought about going on the stage 
 better make up your mind son sabella said  you cant serve cod and salmon she said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the vshaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough 
he daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered dont feel like it he was tempted to tell her about being scared but victoria began yodeling just then and he went home carrying sabella in the back of his head not thinking about her just knowing she was there smiling smelling of peppermints as for his promise oh he had plenty of time buckets of time  we beseech thee lord gord to bless this food that was victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib 
 your daddys in san francisco she told them  he says hell be here on the oneoclock plane fifteen days early isnt that wonderful a cave seemed to be opening in quints stomach  children well have to get organized 
 hurry up were late he said noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning the fog like a rope along the horizon the choppy waves sending off sheets of blue and koolaid green it had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung the first time the nurse took him out of the lung she said if he got frightened shed put him back for a second when bobbie evans smashed up his car the jaguar his wife linda had given him for his last birthday and himself quite thoroughly with it driving back from an afternoons golf at oakmont it seemed to mark the end of a long miswritten chapter in the social life of the community linda looked remote yet lovely in black and everyone held his or her breath 
hadnt linda been a perfect wife to bobbie who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years wasnt john cooper even more attractive at fortyseven than he had been twentyfive years earlier and wasnt johns wife edythe even more appalling if possible didnt john cooper after all this time deserve something better of life wasnt it adult and realistic to look at it that way 
it was the kind of thing that could ruin a mans life and it was a tribute to johns strength of character and very real business ability that it hadnt ruined his  of course there was nothing you could do but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen mousie chandler said to linda stuart linda accepted the reproach which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of #### when she was by all odds the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the allegheny mountains and john was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young men around pittsburgh for it had been john and linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the goggleeyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs john had claimed her from the stag line a young man a year out of dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes 
johnandlinda drove to conneaut in three and a half hours then there was a spat over something as there had been lovers spats before you still said johnandlinda but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or dillinger first it came out after mr coopers will was settled he had died the year before that john and his mother werent rich any more and then there was lindas engagement to bobbie evans 
he was a bright and handsome young man from new york who worked for the same steel company as john did some people said linda had just announced the engagement to jolt john into some action but when john came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe his bride it could no longer be johnandlinda even to sentimental wishful thinkers there was nothing specifically wrong with edythe but there was absolutely nothing right about her either mousie chandler had been to school with her someplace near baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at hornes  well you shouldnt underestimate edythe mousie said 
she is frivolous and scatterbrained but she really isnt shallow bobbie and linda looked magnificent at their wedding she giggled during the ceremony and mousie chandler who was one of lindas bridesmaids said john glared black as death at her  as if he were choking she said edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example 
she didnt have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at longue vue but her bathing suits were far from smart and you didnt see her much at longue vue or anywhere for john had drifted away from the gang mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity others thought he couldnt stand seeing linda mrs bobbie evans still so beautiful so much in command of everything johns mother died not long after his marriage and there was even less cooper money left 
he was not reduced to poverty but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day it probably wasnt hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but edythe to come home to though that may be unfair since ben cooper johns first son came along early in #### the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all cooper from fontanel to pink toes nary a trace of edythe but the continuing charm of the other children sally in #### and jack in #### and all johns success at his work only made edythes dizziness and general uselessness more glaring she never could fit into a crowd which had known which still knew and admired linda 
she managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old mr webber the eldest elder whod never donated more than five dollars to anything had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what edythe called the bosoms of the church john did find the missing checks and money afterward and the drive was actually oversubscribed which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries being an intelligent man john must have guessed what everyone thought about edythe but he never let on by so much as a brave smile poor john was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one he was an attentive and generous husband overgenerous a lot of people felt because they knew that money must be a problem to him 
after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company the coopers saw bobbie and linda socially but no more than was necessary bobbie had been successful too though he didnt match johns pace and after all he didnt need to with all the stuart money he and linda settled down to being social leaders and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year and then came the hairpin turn the smashed jaguar and linda mourning alone and lovely 
 now you know she couldve but she isnt that kind of girl but now well it would be a blessing i think linda evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed bobbies death could move her to feeling what she felt was a bonedeep loss with a sense of waste to it not so much sorrow for handsome ambitious bobbie but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death it was what she had been thinking herself 
there was no one who would blame her or john it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her to send her back to cleveland or anywhere and linda felt capable of capturing the affection of the children anxious even since she and bobbie had had none of their own it would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of linda would have to wait she knew 
years of watching while poor john struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead alloy steels and regular steels had different sales departments at smith & macisaacs where john and bobbie both worked bobbie had been head of the alloy division while john was just another good salesman in the regular branch so when old mr lovejoy the company president talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular steels had gone with carnegieillinois it looked like the perfect chance for bobbie for linda knew how to help her husband not just the stuartfamily contacts but also the little dinners for reuben lovejoy 
 you must have done something something wrong lord knows i had everything set for you bobbie said something about damned pittsburghers sticking together and linda got angry at him they had their first real fight and bobbie went off to get drunk linda dragooned her uncle donald murkland into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened 
but jolly old uncle donald would tell her no more than that bobbie had certainly been considered for the job but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldnt understand he didnt tell her of the long board meeting where bobbie and john were weighed one against the other  im behind john cooper mr lovejoy said finally  i think were agreed that he and evans are equal in ability so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive  now i believe poor johnll work just a little harder 
bobbie with linda behind him will have plenty of other opportunities and also the money cant mean as much to bobbie  bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it poor john will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights worrying about us uncle donald murkland found himself nodding agreement too 
the job at funk wasnt particularly better but it got him away from being subordinate to john and assured him steady advancement since funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of lindas family when he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future she called then to say she had a babysitter for that night  shirley appreciated the chance to make some money such a nice little thing lives right in the building 
i could get along without that three dollars in some ways it was worth being out the money just knowing i was no longer obligated to nadine it was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang i stumbled through the hall wondering who would be calling at this hour i answered to find nadine at the other end 
 janice nobody answers at the apartment that stupid girl might have gone off and left francie  oh she wouldnt do that i said  shes probably fallen asleep and doesnt hear the phone but if youre worried you can go home and check 
old mr thom is already down on wally and we simply cant afford to get ken mad at us i was all set for what came next  janice could you possibly go over and make sure everythings all right ill call you there in ten minutes  i cant make it in ten minutes wondering as i said it why i should make it at all 
so sure that money could do anything not for the dollar or so nadine would give me but because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment and if i didnt go over who would chris was sound asleep and i didnt see any sense in waking him i dressed in the kitchen then left a note on the table telling him what had happened 
 its all right i said as she started to look scared  mrs roberts had called and couldnt wake you i just came over to make sure everything was all right  im hard to wake up she faltered and nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable 
 i didnt know it was going to be this late  thats mrs roberts again i said i crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone i told nadine everything was fine and that id be getting on home  janice would you mind staying 
 wallys drunk ill get him out of here as soon as i possibly can but i dont want shirley to see him like this you know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building not a word of thanks for what id already done she didnt even give me a chance to refuse well there wasnt any law that said i had to stay 
so i told her mrs roberts would pay her in the morning and she scooted off to her own apartment after i looked in at francie i went into the living room and waited i must have dozed off because i came to with a start at the sound of voices nadines shrill with anger wallys loud and thick as i went to the door i heard the clock strike two i opened the door and wally stumbled in fast as if nadine had pushed him 
her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out and if looks could kill wally would have been dead  pack your clothes she hissed  pack and get out  youre crazy wally said thickly he lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it and was instantly asleep 
i grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right and she was crazy  you stay out of this she spat at me  hes ruined us do you hear me hes ruined us  he told ken to his face that he doesnt have what it takes to get a woman and the other people there were listening 
 youd better simmer down i said nervously in the state she was in she could actually kill him  now you just take it easy and ill make you some tea  how can you be so damn stupid ken will never forgive him never 
all we own is francies bedroom set and the televisonrecord player and we even owe on them and well be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours and all because of that i clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth wally cant go any place at this hour  well then ill get out but she looked uncertain 
 you go to bed i said curtly  in the morning you and wally can talk things out she collapsed against me as if everything inside her snapped i got her into bed and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out it was three oclock before i figured it was all right to go 
i had done all i was going to do whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine i drove home found chris still asleep i snuggled up close to him loving him thankful for a man like him in the afternoon nadine and wally came over with francie 
 id had all this trouble with the old man thats why i drank so much i got fired yesterday for not attending to business old mr thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job wally confessed and couldnt get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side mr thom had gotten wally on the phone and fired him 
 but ken got coy and wouldnt make any promises and i was plastered and i blew my stack  and told him right to his face hed never slept with a woman i tried to quiet nadine because the children were there but she was beyond caring what she said 
but i couldnt help thinking that nadine and wally were getting just what they deserved now maybe theyd realize that life can be tough little by little during the week chris and i discovered the crazy unbelievable way nadine and wally had lived they had not only spent every cent they were in debt up to their necks owing on everything they owned on top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent and the day wally received written notice that he was fired they were evicted 
he had fallen into a soft job and now the job was gone and he was stranded  i wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over i said i wished we were too it was easy enough to say it because of course we couldnt spare a cent  im glad you feel that way honey 
we can let them move in with us it was incredible he gave me an embarrassed pleading look but it would only be for a couple of weeks until they get straightened out straightened out theyd had years of making all that money  i wont do it i said flatly 
well now she can sleep in the street for all i care  that isnt like you janice chris said uncomfortably i didnt want to be like that mean and bitter but darn it all why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us but in the end we did 
the finance company took all their furniture and they didnt have a cent to their name to my way of thinking he was scared sick his luck had failed him and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world chris made trip after trip in our old car moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries nadine had bought on special at least well eat i thought grimly as i put all the food away 
when she wasnt crying she was in our bedroom fighting with wally  virus infection nothing shed scream at him  youre too lazy to go out and look for another job but it couldnt go on forever a couple of weeks chris had said i figured i could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks 
nadines constant nagging had finally gotten wally out of bed he set out every morning looking for work and come home around noon full of alibis and excuses  you can get something nadine would snap  you can get a job working in a grocery store if nothing else  the high school kids have got everything sewed up he said a whine in his voice 
 by fall theyll be back in school id say trying to sound encouraging but this was only the middle of july and i couldnt take six more weeks of this i mentioned it to chris one stifling hot night when i had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air but i swear to you from the moment i opened my eyes i knew it was going to be a bad day 
part of it was being so tired id not only had my usual full day yesterday but a dinner meeting as well that kept me up late but the rest of it the main part wasnt based on logic at all it was just going to be one of those days for the thousandth time i wished id chosen some nice ninetofive fivedaysaweek profession and for the thousandth time i answered myself 
actually i shouldnt complain i told myself in the shaving mirror i had a lot to be thankful for a profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasnt to be sneezed at maybe i didnt see as much of gladdy as id like but how much worse it would have been if id had to board her out somewhere after alice went send my daughter to an orphanage or a boardinghome at least we were together and we had mrs hodges bless her to look after us no mother could be fonder of gladdy than mrs hodges was 
especially in the way gladdy had turned out growing up without a mother from the time she was three it wasnt a good thing for a child even knowing the kind of mother alice had been she is a closed book a picture i keep on my bureau but never look at if shed kept on as shed been going the story id told gladdy would probably have been true by now anyhowas usual gladdys bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table 
it made me feel good and knowing that shed decided all on her own to go to college right here in town made me feel good too oh i knew that i couldnt give myself all the credit for her decision i had a feeling that young pete michelson the most promising intern at fairview had something to do with it too shed been out with pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little but once i was alone again driving to the hospital the heaviness returned 
should i tell him the truth about alice did he have a right to know the secret id kept from gladdy all these years the boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when i got to fairview two interns and dick ishii the other resident im chief of medicine here and this morning would start like all others with me taking the boys on the rounds 
there wasnt anything of special interest that morning no one sicker than they should have been pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on seven hed had a case of postoperative shock but it was all taken care of now seven is a womens floor and as it happened not very busy right then when wed finished our regular rounds pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor  got a new one in last night he said 
the ward was a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics we didnt get many at fairview and they were never pretty sights it was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward the moment i walked in the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed theyd cleaned her up some of course and shed pretty much slept off her drunk 
alice but this womans name was rose bancroft yes rose bancroft diagnosis acute alcoholism she looked about sixty though i recalled that the chart gave her age as fortyfour an ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face already marred by the telltale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry her coarse hair was twocolored bleached blonde and its real dirty gray 
in a low voice dick filled us inshed been picked up downtown passed out in the doorway although quiet when they brought her in shed suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out wed keep her a day or two and the aa people would talk to her but if she wasnt interested shed just go back to the same life shed left 
i tell you it took every ounce of control i had to be able to speak  now miss or is it mrs bancroft i never liked going straight into an examination with patients it relaxes them ive always thought to chat first this was one time id have gladly broken my own rule but habit was too strong but those penetrating eyes i had to turn my head away 
 i been spotting a little now and then she said quietly no emotion in her voice  have you spoken to a doctor about it once again there was a negative shake i told miss groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table  better do a papanicolaou i told pete 
pete stood by with a slide and took the smear sent it down to the lab with a request for the test that done i told miss groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind i was busy the rest of the day late in the afternoon i was up on seven again one of my private patients was being admitted and i went in to see her settled 
 ive got the results on the bancroft smear test he said do you want to talk to her doctor  well i didnt i didnt ever want to see that woman again well do a d and c and get her permission for a hysterectomy maybe its nothing maybe its intraepithelial or in situ cant take any chances 
 groggins tells me shes started badgering already wants to get out wants to get to her booze i guess  well better see what i can do wed been standing right outside miss bancrofts door and as i went to turn the knob to enter i was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar but she seemed to be dozing and in any case wed been talking in low tones 
 i sure cant complain about the service in this place she said  i just got through seeing one of you guys there was something almost insulting in her tone but i disregarded it  ive just been talking to dr michelson i said  wed like you to have a dilatation and curettage 
but we would like your permission to do that is to go further if it proves necessary actually i rather doubt that well have to do this even if we do youll be out of here in a week probably i was sure that was the difficulty she just didnt want to stay here where she couldnt get to the liquor id had patients whod refused surgery before of course but never one who didnt show in one way or another the reason why 
 will you tell me why  you shouldnt tell your little secrets outside of the patients door she said  ive got cancer havent i  im not going to be one of your guinea pigs let your pupils learn on someone else doctor 
even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone this was someone whod come down in the world i thought again there was something familiar about her something  you havent got cancer i said as strongly as i could  i dont know what you heard that would make you think so but i assure you i dont even know myself so how can you be so sure 
she could have found out my first name of course that wouldnt be difficult but there was that something some echo in the way she spoke she was watching me intently a funny little halfsmile on her lips but you havent changed much joe i knew then knew with a heartstopping shock 
 whats the matter joe you scared of me think im going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife  but why did you come back  where have you been all these years as for coming back here well ill tell you the truth i didnt even know where i was when i came to 
the way she spoke her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout made me shudder  i never asked you for any favors joe she went on but im asking one now you doctors are all alike all you want is to cut up people and whats the good no i want out joe i looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me 
what shed said was true in all these years shed never asked for anything from me if i let her go shed disappear once more i was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any womans the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air i breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic 
i no longer knew how deep i was somewhere under ### feet getting drunker happier and more contented by the second the reasons for this dive seemed foolish now the metaltasting nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water perhaps if i took off the aqualung i could swim better love my woman better i chuckled aloud and the mouthpiece fell out 
it was when i packed up what duds i had and went to paris it was no vacation just me getting out after a bellyfull wild kicks never are but i hoped to dig up a better frame of mind once before i had been to paris long before i married valery that first time was good and it stuck with me 
it was a saturday evening in april with a mistlike rain and i was a little high on the good taste of life i had a pocketful of money which was unusual when i was in the army and the plane would be grounded all night in less than an hour i had gotten a hotel showered shaved and was out on the champs elysees in a fresh uniform all the women were beautiful and the men were equal to them there were some sweet machines other than women an old bugatti a lean farina coachwork on an american chassis a swallow a type a##ajk mercedes and lots more 
i had champagne at maxims then went into a cafe called the jour et nuit to ask the way to montmartre she was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could and washing it down with red wine i didnt know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful she was blonde and young and nice and round in a tight white dress maybe her ravenous eating wasnt grotesque because she was so positive about it 
 handsome soldier i have assuaged one hunger with food  madame i said with noblesse oblige because of the handsome yeah and so off we went to her apartment she was a nymphomaniac of course the poor girl toward the break of day i waxed philosophical and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese 
i made the mistake of going to the jour et nuit the place was busy but i didnt feel like a hun i sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up i had part of a bottle of french beer called panther pils so help me then switched to tuborg after a few hours life hadnt showed and i was crocked 
all that day and monday i drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space i read the tropic of capricorn and the tropic of cancer i was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when i dozed off i felt better tuesday evening when i woke up my head was clear my thinking sober and i was reconciled to this paris idea as a flop on top of all my others 
sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park and i sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky there was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night i had on only a topcoat but i wasnt cold pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick 
suddenly i understood why she had the umbrella without it she would have been drab and limp it gave her the right to sit down beside me back straight one hand out on the handle she was another human being and happened to be a hustler i didnt much care if she were there or not 
hardly glancing at her i smiled a bleak one which said thanks baby but id rather be alone she was silent for a while then said why are you so unhappy  im not unhappy i lied staring at the snow she was trying to make a hole in my armor and i didnt want it she must have seen the ring on my left hand 
 ah monsieur it is not my business to wager it this took me so funny i had to look at her i felt my frozen sad face crumble and i grinned a silly one i couldnt have helped she smiled at me but it was an awfully sad smile her eyes were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them 
because i liked this sad person so much i said will you have a drink with me i could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes and i wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit anyway i pulled a bottle of remy martin out of my topcoat drew the cork and passed it to her  im sorry i havent got a glass i said  non non she said taking the bottle not for that be sorry 
its really rotten to drink good cognac like that but i hadnt cared before i wasnt going to lug around a glass there wasnt much light in the blue dark but i could see her well no child this tart she must have been thirtyfive or even forty not good looking but selfconfident and wise so that it made her attractive 
we finished the bottle i hadnt had a lot out of it earlier not speaking much to each other and we stayed sober i suppose we were cold but we didnt feel it we seemed to be drowsing sadly soberly in the cold cold air while the snow fell then she said allons and we got up and went to my hotel without another word we undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance i had once known with valery 
she had a funny little scar on her stomach on the left side i think we were very tired for we awoke at the same moment deeply rested surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows which were wet where the rime had melted i felt wonderful the absolute opposite of last nights melancholy i was hungry as a wolf and my body felt lean and vital  bon jour i said brightly sitting up which pulled the covers to her hips 
with a laugh she beat me to the bathroom i called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her she came out pink from a hot bath and i gave her my robe i had brushed my teeth showered shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast  the toothbrush monsieur he said presenting it 
i wondered if i ought to go use the new one myself but i smelled the coffee and thinking what the hell live dangerously i decided i would scald my worries away the coffee wasnt very hot though made in a filter pot but it was good we sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham hot hardboiled eggs and hot garlic bread her name was suzanne and mine stephen 
 you are very tactful do you know stephen she remarked  yes because you didnt run off to use that new toothbrush i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror  i didnt really use yours she went on i know men never kiss les putains 
she smiled all the way to her wise sad eyes and drained her own i asked touching the scar on her stomach it was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle the cynicism was back in her eyes a bitter wisdom and i wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all she understood sex anyway and played at it well 
it was a nice place not filled with smoke the sommelier brought the wine first a magnum instead of the bottle i had ordered he must have thought i was a tourist i fixed him with a steely eye and said whats this for i didnt ask for a jeroboam of champagne 
two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield she put them in her bag she would not stop to read them in american express as many were doing sitting on benches or leaning against the walls but pushed her way out into the street this was her first day in rome and it was june an enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead in her minds eye her imagination responding fully almost exhaustingly to these shores peculiar powers of stimulation she saw the city as from above telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked aqueducts and tombs here a cypress there a pine and all around the low blue hills 
she would see them looking just as they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight moreover nursing various stubblefields her aunt then her mother then her father through their lengthy illnesses everybody could tell you the stubblefields were always sick theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot england france germany switzerland and italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight to see all these places with her own eyes the very night after her fathers funeral she had thought though never admitted to a soul now i can go so here it was here was italy anyway and terribly noisy 
cars taxis buses and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain shoals of tourists went by her in national groups english school girls in blue uniforms german boys with cameras attached smartly dressed americans looking in shop windows glad to be alone theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left something special was going on here just now the annual display of azalea plants she had heard about it the night before at her hotel 
the azaleas were as large as shrubs and their myriad blooms many still tight in the bud ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink along with many white ones too marvelous thought theresa climbing in her portly wellbred way for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything in rome all over europe she intended to move very slowly indeed halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down other people were doing it too sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above watching the azaleas mass or just enjoying the sun 
the sun warmed her as it seemed to be warming everything perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette how could you be both at once presently she picked up the first of the letters a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay 
poor cousin elec she thought tears rising to sting in the sun but why couldnt he have arranged to live through the summer and how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her her cousin emma carraway had written it in her loose high old ladys script ts carefully crossed but ls inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope cousin emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield rome italy on the envelope had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka alabama and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her nextdoor neighbor 
 across the envelope and now theresa had it all as easily as if she had been the president of the republic or the pope inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness death and burial of cousin alexander carraway cousin emma and cousin elec brother and sister unmarried devoted aging had lived next door to the stubblefields in tuxapoka from time immemorial until the stubblefields had moved to montgomery fifteen years ago two days before he was taken sick cousin elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas and cousin elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a motherofpearl paper knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died im supposed to care as much now as then as much here as there she realized with a sigh 
she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope and turned with relief to one from her brother george but alas george when he had written had only just returned from going to tuxapoka to cousin elecs funeral all the fine old stock was dying out look at the world today his own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for his grandchildren he had one so far still in diapers he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived had to be known at first hand 
theresa had seen him through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife anne had not seemed to understand poor george could it just be theresa wondered that anne had understood only too well and that george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull as for cousin alexander carraway the only thing theresa could remember at the moment about him except his paper knife was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one oclock in the morning the whole stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at cousin emmas call first papa then mother then theresa and george there they all did their uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot he had hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped in his bathrobe on a footstool 
they all surrounded him the family circle theresa and george as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens and cousin emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan  can you think of anything to do  i hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up ill just have to can you think of anything to do  you might treat it like the hiccups said papa 
 i just hope this happens to you someday said cousin elec who was not at his best  poor cousin elec george said he was younger than theresa she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused now here they both were still the same george full of roundeyed woe and cousin emma in despair  of course georges letter continued there are practical problems to be considered 
robbie and beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them and anne and i have told her shes more than welcome here but i think she feels that she might be an imposition especially as long as our rosie is still in high school the other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that tuxapoka is populated with miss edna whittaker for example but there is more in this than meets the eye a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off 
 i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best i really shouldnt have smoked a cigarette so early in the day thought theresa it always makes me sick ill start sneezing in a minute sitting on these cold steps she got up standing uncertainly for a moment then moving aside to let go past her talking a group of young men 
yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome and felt themselves to be so just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos parker fountain pens rosaries papal portraits he knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them carrozza rides in the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialized theresa turned away to escape and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two 
the lady with the alligator bag registered interest doubt then indignation she cast about as though looking for a policeman this really shouldnt be allowed finally she scurried away up the steps theresa stubblefield still holding the family letters in one hand realized that her whole trip to europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between cousin elecs death and doing something about cousin emma they were even anne and george probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out one or two countries and come home in august to get cousin emmas house ready before the teachers came to tuxapoka in september 
the trouble is theresa thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow it never registered with them that i had time to read all of balzac dickens and stendhal while papa was dying not to mention everything in the city library after mothers operation it would have been exactly the same to them if i had read through all twentysix volumes of elsie dinsmore she arranged the letters carefully one on top of the other 
she became aware that two italian workmen carrying a large azalea pot were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display  mi diapiace signora ma insomma she indicated a spot a little distance away i knew it as surely as everybody in westfield that lucille was a husband stealer you cant keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only ####plus 
just as it has its susan dolan though nobodyd ever bothered to tell me that they even talked about lucille down at the young christians league where i spent a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission i never heard my folks talk about her though they were goodliving religious people and i can truthfully say i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody even if they ever did say anything about people like lucille warren i know they wouldnt have dreamed of saying it in front of me 
and so i was really upset the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing mrs warren i asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck he gave me a straight honest answer  look sue baby hed said much as i love you well a guys a guy and lucilles willing to to come across 
i guess it was at that moment that i realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren my love for johnnie was young and clean how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who didnt hesitate to use her sex johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line it was a vivid sharp february morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing some stuff dad had ordered i wasnt in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men but the moment i saw johnnie i knew he was different 
he had an easy masculine grace about him the kind that kids dont have but that i had sometimes admired in other older men his smile was quick and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me too i could hardly believe such good luck was mine and now lucille warren had gotten a look at him 
a man had to have his release at least thats what the boys used to say in high school and i wasnt providing it for johnnie she wouldnt have even if hed asked her but he wouldnt ask her he wasnt the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will and he wouldnt leave her either hed told me that he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy 
it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time against my folks wishes wed been seeing each other for short rides in the truck the rides were tame enough mostly we talked but by the time the first crackling of spring came around we both knew we were hopelessly in love yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck a little 
 i always imagined i would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that  and you fall for a lumber jockey  and i was ticking off the items on my fingers swears too much and goes out with the boys whoever they are too much and who ever goes to church and wont even listen when i try to persuade him to come back to the fold  i could walk out the door  and never show my face or my truck around here again 
i huddled miserably beside him in the truck it was all my doing his seeing her johnnie and i had been innocent in our love and that was the way i wanted to keep it at first johnnie hadnt understood how could he not being a religious person like me but then he had said all right kid if thats how you want it thats how itll be 
i had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman i had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil so one week later i surrendered to him in the little motel on route ## i was desperate to hold him to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed and to keep him from the clutches of lucille warren and though at the time i blushed to admit it even to myself there was in me a growing desire a sexual awareness that johnnie had set in motion an awareness that no other man had ever triggered 
astonishingly enough it was my own voice i heard there in the darkness begging this man to make love to me outside in the summertime fields behind the motel a thousand crickets serenaded us  will you always love me this way and i snuggled closer to the man i loved it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced 
 it cant be wrong can it its never wrong if love is real i took great comfort from his words and smiled to myself in the darkness i felt no conflict between what i was doing and my strict religious upbringing i had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids and many times i had thought about my love for johnnie who being thirty brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about 
i was practically a bride after all there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible wouldnt johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness hed not only told me so hed proved it it wasnt johnnies fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable 
and if i could contribute to that id do it no price is too high when true love is at stake and i had no doubts about how true this love was id never even petted with a boy and after i met johnnie he never touched me for the longest while not until i all but threw myself at him he was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman and i figured that emotionally i was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half 
it wasnt i was sure a difference in age that came between people but a difference in maturity and hadnt i rescued him from lucille warren shed have gotten him if i hadnt stopped her after all lucille warren was a husbandstealer from way back but id been a good girl and now god was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we shared 
 always and always johnnie a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow from the entire eastern half of the nation theyd be coming members of the young christians league and id been chosen to represent our chapter id been seeing johnnie almost a year now but i still didnt want to leave him for five whole days but i had looked forward so much to being with this church group 
i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group the first meeting was held in faneuil hall a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states my cousin alma at whose home i was staying during the convention introduced me to a group of young people from rhode island one of them was a very friendly lovely fellow named ronald a boy about my age with slick blond hair and dancing blue eyes he looked very different from johnnie in fact he looked sort of like me 
after the meeting there was going to be a party at someones house i assumed alma would get me there but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up we were separated outside the hall i anxiously looked around for her then all at once there was a hand on my elbow  hey there beautiful twin of mine ronald said  need a pumpkin to get to the party 
by the time we arrived the party was already going strong a couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and i realized they were drinking my folks wouldnt dream of having alcohol in the house so my first taste of it had been of course with johnnie i hadnt liked it at first it was bitter and burning but when johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale i enjoyed it 
johnnie i suddenly realized hed been totally out of my thoughts all evening but that was only natural i decided surely he was still resting snugly in my heart  i dont see alma anywhere i said cmon lets find out where theyre keeping the glasses 
but at least come along while i get lubricated strange faces most of them and i wasnt even sure all of them had come from the league meeting under normal circumstances he had a certain brighteyed allamericanboy charm with great appeal for young ladies old ladies and dogs today he looked like an astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space hollow eyes hollow cheeks hollow stomach a shot of orange juice would make everything seem better 
 you share a refrigerator mrs kirby had said and somehow at midnight after the long drive from new york in pelting rain that had sounded reasonable in the cold light of day it seemed a lunatic arrangement share bath maybe but share refrigerator she had explained it something about summer peoples eating out and not enough space in the units he remembered seeing it last night when he put away his small store of bachelortype eatables 
it was still raining and mrs kirbys cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore vivid blue and green and magenta charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long skinny green pills his spirits as damp as the day this vacation had seemed like a good idea last week when his doctor had prescribed it  take a full month the doctor had said  lots of sun lots of rest 
you young men get to be my age you wont take flu so lightly the doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi but charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew too that there was no pill to cure it he had loved and lost vivian wayne to somebody else had watched her marry the somebody else and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride goodby forever which was really piling it on he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed distrust of women 
from now on his was going to be a mans world the north woods duck blinds at dawning beer and poker and male secretaries meanwhile he had this miserable cold and as he leaned against the refrigerator watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet the doctors prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery in these damp circumstances he was an oddson bet to develop pneumonia he looked up to see mrs kirby awesome in a blackandyellow polkadotted slicker bearing down on him he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of pyhrric victory over the tourists 
 i hope so he said thought id bake it out in the sun better get in out of the wet charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal peony being less than weatherproof as for its being fine day after tomorrow he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again with vivian lost to him forever 
all charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon a salami sandwich for lunch and a lonely old age if he lived that long he leafed through the light reading provided by mrs kirby for her guests four separate adventures of the bobbsey twins at the seashore at the mountains on the farm and in danger and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoofandmouth disease in cattle hideously illustrated he dozed only to dream of vivian and woke only to crash into the night table bruising his other shin he took a yellow pill only to choke on it and went for the salami only to find something alive in the refrigerator something pink and fuzzy his first thought was that mrs kirby in her mania for color had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in 
he thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator got the salami bread and a bermuda onion and put the whole thing out of his mind next morning he found a note in the refrigerator  would you mind wrapping your onion everything being the sweater a lipstick case and a squirt bottle of kissin kare pink hand lotion the note paper was pink too and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine 
he scrawled sorry across the bottom of the note and then against his better judgment added dont you eat he didnt want to encourage anything here but on the other hand he didnt want her swiping his salami  not onions came the answer the following day must have really smelled up her sweater he thought and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fastfrozen 
now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would not be pink they would be black or white or horseblanket plaid chic and splashy like vivian herself pink vivian once had told him was for baby girls and grownup girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy  why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator it was mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails 
i must remember to warn the girl next to you in larkspur he could hear mrs kirby now warning her pale guest against sunburn  i spoke to the fellow next door too she might say clearly two damp days with the bobbsey twins had done him no good the sun blazing hot as prophesied was far from kind to mrs kirbys varicolored properties 
this weekend he thought he would look around for some more subdued retreat with cape roses maybe at the door he could not imagine a flowers being brave enough to grow beside peony larkspur and the rest the sweater was gone from the refrigerator and in its place was a large plastic bag full of wet pink clothes no wonder she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes he got a red pill and a beer and then on impulse transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled be my guest on the wrapping 
the note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript youre not at all well are you  ive got this cold he wrote not that it was any of her business  its none of my business said the next note but my aunt elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold and she lived to be ninetysix i mean shes still living and shes ninetysix 
by the next morning she had turned the paper over he stuck his head in mrs kirbys little rental office  i guess that redhead next to me took your advice i havent seen her on the beach  you wont if youre looking for a redhead 
there were pink bathing suits on blondes and brownyhaired girls in red or black or green bathing suits there were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits up on a dune he saw a girl all by herself sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting he paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white one of those bulky turtleneck sweaters on the beach there were pale girls and notsopale girls 
at two that morning he was still walking up and down peony up and down the veranda up and down the silent moonlit beach finally in desperation he opened the refrigerator filched her hand lotion and left a note  ive got this sunburn said the note and i used some of your hand lotion  of course i dont mind she answered  youre having a miserable time arent you 
this was a very warm sympathetic girl he decided sympathy is a fine quality in a woman now vivian for instance was not too long on sympathy she felt and said that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves it was a tough world and you had to be tough to hold your own 
charlie couldnt see vivian offering any hand lotion she might peel him once the worst of the agony was over charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms waiting for the fire in his back to subside and used generous quantities of the hand lotion the only thing this lotion has glycerin in it and that whitens the skin so if youre so anxious to get a tan you may not want to use it  im not that anxious but maybe thats why youre so fair 
do you have anything to read while youre shut up there are two things here about surviving in the wilderness and a book called tom swift and his speedy canoe but the picture of tom swift is pretty sinister there was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot the new riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop 
then in the fifth annistons kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field eddie lee riversides redheaded playing manager ran after the ball but it rolled past him phil rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to phil phil spun around and made an accurate throw into mike deegans hands on third base 
but the anniston boy had begun his slide too late he came into the bag with his body and mike deegan brought the ball down full in his face he jumped to his feet and started to throw punches mike deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher this brought in everybody from both sides while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar 
when the inning was over he cursed the anniston catcher all the way into the dugout phil rossoff coming in from left field stopped at the water fountain for a drink mike deegan was standing beside it facing the field he was eyeing the anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began  keep your eyes open sonny 
this so infuriated deegan that he spun around and said ill get that little bastard so help me god ill get him phil rossoff said why dont you leave him alone  mind your own goddamn business mike deegan said he stepped into the dugout wondering why deegan was always looking for trouble 
in the last of the sixth inning mike deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielders head by the time the fielder got his hands on the ball deegan was rounding third base and heading for home the left fielder threw and it was a good one but mike had no chance of being tagged all deegan had to do was slide fall away but instead he rammed into the catcher 
the anniston players and their manager ran out on the field the riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer then quickly and a little nervously the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room mike deegan was sitting on the bench watching when the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said that ought to teach the sonofabitch 
the anniston manager was coming over to the riverside dugout he was followed by four of his men it began to look as if something was going to happen mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer eddie lee moved over to mike deegans side 
 deegan the manager said his voice pitched low quivering  that was a rotten thing to do  for gods sake mike said waving the manager away tell your guys not to block the plate  you didnt have to ram him 
he called in the pitcher who had been pitching and a big heavy powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for anniston the game started again and in the eighth inning mike deegan came up to bat everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting the first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for mikes head deegan fell into the dirt the ball going over him 
in the riverside dugout frankie ricco shortstop whispered into phils ear theres gonna be a fight mike was slow getting into the box this time when he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in  one more and im coming out there mike deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat 
the pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for mikes head deegan dropped got up turned and holding the bat with both hands up against his chest began to walk slowly out to the mound the pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards mike deegan they were both walking towards each other unhurried riverside and anniston players rushed out on the field 
mike and the anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together phil rossoff and two other riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started after the game phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when mike deegan came in  its a helluva thing mike said looking at phil when a guys own teammate wont come out and help him in a fight phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head 
mike went over to phil and stood over him  why the hell didnt you come out when you saw them gang up on me  i didnt think it was necessary mike placed both his hands on his hips  listen wise guy if you think im gonna do all the fighting for this ball club youre crazy 
 i didnt ask you to fight for the ball club phil said slowly  you trying to say i started the fight  im not trying to say anything phil turned away and opened his locker and then he heard mike deegan say youre yellow rossoff and phil banged his locker door shut and spun around 
 phil come into my office eddie said phil followed eddie into the office and shut the door  im doing you a favor eddie said quickly  you get your unconditional release as of today  the best thing for you to do eddie said is go home 
 but it does confirm what ive suspected all along  sit down sit down eddie said i am saying youre not a professional ballplayer you havent got the heart for baseball  what the hell do you think baseball is 
phil started to say something but eddie cut him short  now dont tell me what a good ball player you are but what you havent got is the heart to back up that talent with you just havent got the heart for proball and thats it dazed phil said i dont get it 
 what difference does your batting average make i tell you when its necessary to hurt in order to win you wont do it thats what i mean by no heart for the game deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there he did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission thats one less who might take his job away later on 
its a way of life goddamit and youve got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you  i think youre wrong eddie he said finally youll get your pay in the morning phil turned and left the room hearing eddie say someday youll see i was right 
phil said i got my release  i dont know phil said then frankie said what are you gonna do phil started to take his clothes off and frankie sat down on the bench again phil took off one shoe and stared at it 
 hell plenty of guys get let out and come back later the leagues are full of guys like that  what are you gonna do phil  why not try another club what the hell right did eddie have saying a thing like that 
he just didnt know what he was talking about saying a thing like that  will you do it phil  ill talk to him all right  im not worried about it phil said what else did eddie have to say 
his broad reading took him into certain byways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him when he was twelve he took to reading st augustine and aquinas then laotse confucius mencius suzuki hindu tomes by endless krishnaists and numerous socioarchaeological papers for his birthday because richard had seen them in a store and asked for them his mother bought him the zendavesta and a little image of the indian god acala and one day on her own his mother came home with a present entitled the book of the dead which she suspected richard would enjoy he was enormously happy with her gift and smiled then went to his room to read 
 did you think there were two  you dont understand richard said gloomily through quiet laughter his mother said dont speak to your father like that richard richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didnt speak to his parents about religion again his interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian affairs 
richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired in his remoteness a thorough if bookish knowledge of asian lore literature life politics and history he was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of acala and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country his mother who had seen little of him for four years appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an orient which she herself having slight knowledge of it had to be distrusted she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested  do you still have the book of the dead 
 yes he lied to shorten the conversation i still have it he was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father no matter the subject as for the book of the dead it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in new york he had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and trembling at having to open the big furnace given them up to the flames then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried 
during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure he stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty north pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water it was so dark that he didnt see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it it was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind in tokyo richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in new york except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend 
he had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo in charlotte richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which after a fashion he envied in time he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity she convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small teadrinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations at one such gathering charlotte announced i was at ryusenji today 
 well its at fudomae and there was a tan young man quite naked taking a shower in the pool richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation but charlottes manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it three of the four persons present all foreign students in tokyo had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy was used as the modifier soba udon and tea were in because they could be taken noisily sashimi was in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to stay out even if it was a little pretentious 
 he wasnt the least bit disturbed by my watching him said charlotte  i shouldnt have been able to do that  well i was able to do it charlotte said with no sign of irritation sam i thought you knew everything about tokyo  ive heard about it samuel burns said 
 yes a little parkish place charlotte said and concluded anyhow its all very nice and the man who brought sweet potatoes into kanto is buried there next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo oh thats what i meant to tell you this is the interesting part richard she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking  there was that fellow out there in the bitter cold 
 and the water would be still colder ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it  and your golden god said samuel burns probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath  but the point is charlotte said there he was freezing naked in a little stream of water at ryusenji all in worship of fudo the god of fire richards dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light fudo the god of wisdom was also thought of as the japanese version of acala 
he found himself trying to remember something but he couldnt decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall he had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at ryusenji he was unable to put it together that night after leaving charlottes apartment richard walked about for a time before returning to his room when he at last did go to his room he couldnt sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of acala thinking first of charlottes tale of the man at ryusenji then of his biwa and the invisible pacific waters 
he was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte had mentioned he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool on the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of fudo or perhaps a demon the strange creature housed in wire made him shudder the sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountainfalls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach 
into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundredyen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze but the spirit he wished to call out would not he knew come in the person of the temple priest instead he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated fudo at their head the black fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and richards eyes were caught by the fudos in fascination and then richard was shocked as all at once flames shot out from the sharp features of fudos face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it then the flames were gone the stillness fell upon the severe black face and richard began to tremble violently 
he walked all the miles back to his room he seemed to have picked up a virus that day because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot he stayed home reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at ryusenji but the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldnt rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day the cold lingered making sleep difficult that night and he remained in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal the wretched sound the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life 
i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings it had grown hot early that day and i hoped that the boy my brothers son would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground carrying the jar of cool water the boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water and he always dragged an old snowfence lath or a stick along to play with he pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing tractor sounds with his lips i almost ran over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time 
it lay half in the furrow and half out and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when i put in the clutch the tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth and the tractor stopped instantly the snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made into the furrow and did not go any further i had never liked snakes much i still had that kind of quick panic that id had as a child whenever i saw one but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful he was multicolored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly 
i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out hoping to frighten him with the noise but the snake only flicked its black forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern i let the engine idle then and i got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it my movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again and its tongue was working very rapidly i followed it looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back the colors clear and sharp and perfect in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a babys fist down its back and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jetblack the colors were astonishing clear and bright and it was as if the body held a fire of its own and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin vivid and alive and warm 
his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth you beauty i said i couldnt kill you i had killed snakes before when i was younger but there had been no animal like this one and i knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die i picked him up and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant firecolored body like splendid ice and i knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him like fieldmice swallowed whole might make the body caressed through my hands like cool satin and my hands usually tanned and dark were pale beside it and i asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body 
the snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods the sharp burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target i felt good and satisfied looking at the snake it shone in its bright diamond color against the sunburned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself the color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien too in that dry and dusty and uncolored field 
i had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house the earth was a little heavy and i had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake the boy was there at the lower corner of the field and he was in the plowed earth stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience even at that distance with no sound but the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy i could see the hunchedup shoulders the savage determination the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick 
i stopped the tractor and i shouted down to the boy and i knew he could hear me for the morning was clear and still but he did not even hesitate in that brutal murdering dance i felt myself tremble thinking of the diamond light of that beauty i had held a few moments before and i wanted to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch the boy in the moment of his savagery and save a glimmer a remnant of that which i remembered but i knew it was already too late i drove the tractor on not looking down there i was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on my head began to ache and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes and i hated the job suddenly and i thought there are only moments when one sees beautiful things and these are soon crushed or they vanish 
he was eleven and we had done many things together he was a beautiful boy really with finelyspun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike and his eyes were blue he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up as he would smile on any other day he was my nephew my brothers son handsome and warm and newlyscrubbed with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brothers and mine as well i saw then too the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil through something there where i had been not long before 
 can i ride around with you he asked as he often did and i had as often let him be on the tractor beside me i looked closely at his eyes and he was already innocent the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his  no you cannot i said pushing aside the water jar he offered to me 
 yes he said eagerly beginning a kind of dance of excitement he tried to take my hand to show me  why did you kill it didnt you see how beautiful it was  snakes are ugly he said again 
have you ever seen anything like it around here  snakes are ugly and bad and it might have bitten somebody and they would have died  you know there are no poisonous snakes in this area  they eat chickens sometimes the boy said  they are ugly and they eat chickens and i hate snakes 
 you killed it because you wanted to kill it for no other reason  theyre ugly and i hate them the boy insisted  it was beautiful i said half to myself the boy skipped along beside me and he was contented with what he had done the fire of the colors was gone 
the beautifullytapered head so delicate and so cool had been flattened as if in a vise and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted torn mouth the snake was hideous and i remembered even then the cool bright fire of it only a little while before and i thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life i wrenched the stake out that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body between the colored diamond crystals i touched it and the coolness the icefeeling was gone and even then it moved a little perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles and i hoped that it was truly dead so that i would not have to kill it and then it moved a little more and i knew the snake was dying and i would have to kill it there 
im sorry i thought to the snake for you were beautiful i took the broken length of it around the tractor and i took one of the wrenches from the toolkit and i struck its head not looking at it to kill it at last for it could never live the boy came around behind me dragging the stake  its a big snake isnt it  im going to tell everybody how big a snake i killed 
 dont you see the difference now  its an ugly terrible snake he said he came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes i could see the happiness in the boys eyes the gleeful brutality he looked up at me puzzled and he swayed his head from side to side 
i wanted to slap his face to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth and i decided then very suddenly what i would do cady didnt come unglued easily but this had not been a day of glad tidings tax worries production worries personnel worries and the letter from hanford college his own alma mater a real snapper hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago yes the boys credentials were in order scholastic transcript character references picture health record successful college boards 
cady partlow lit his pipe with no comfort this was the letter which would or would not enroll his son david in hanford his son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life his son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor lawyer merchant or chief he wondered if he had played it wrong 
besides cady partlow knew he wasnt the oldgradtype look at pete alcorn who hadnt missed a hanford ball game in fifteen years hanford college little ivy league had no room for football players with low grades cady looked at his own sons scholastic record with pride good solid b average with a sprinkling of as in math and science 
mr partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at hanford but then he hadnt studied very hard getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking he put down his pipe and started to type  in response to your letter i can in good conscience recommend my son david in the field of leadership 
he didnt have to be told his son looked like him david had the same gray eyes high cheekbones dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness he turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence  his interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics tennis and swimming his chief motivation for enrolling at hanford is the desire to 
he paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build how do you tell a college president that your son doesnt know what he wants to do that you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club of course david has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer or a lawyer or an editor how do you tell a college like hanford that your son has a vast potential that he will find himself just give him time give him a chance 
what a production to make of a letter commending your own son his eyebrow went up in amusement at his soulsearching panic he told hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics he told hanford his son had participated in numerous highschool activities he belonged to a social club a civic group little theater swimming team and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club 
then he met the grave eyes of his wife anne from the photograph next to davids he shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket better show it to anne and see if he had omitted anything after all his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of partlow products half of it was natural half was smith college 
she said what she meant and let it be he could take the advice or leave it he whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator  you look like you just heard a real gasser mr partlow cady looked at tom who had taken him up and down for fifteen years 
when i went to college they begged you to come now you have to be well rounded firm in motivation and prepacked with knowledge tom slid open the door to the lobby my john applied to six colleges before he got in hes president of the rocket club here you know 
he got a science scholarship to yale  oh said mr partlow thats fine tom as he drove home through the thinning traffic cady felt the unease growing he hadnt told anyone but he too had applied to five colleges for david he suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the martini anne had waiting for him 
nor did looking at anne ease the tension as it usually did he liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose from those navyblue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as david did she always could sense the shag end of a woolly day  board meeting tonight cady 
 why not let him take it cady i know it is midweek but its only eight days before commencement cady deep in thought neither heard nor answered carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly mr chairman cady partlows head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse 
 hear anything from hanford yet dad dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys charles burke got turned down by dartmouth and he is a straighta student anne said it wasnt surprising because charles was antisocial a lone wolf and completely onesided  i can hardly say the same about you dave 
anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable booklined room  i didnt know i looked so dilapidated your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it hanford college hasnt decided on daves application yet 
cady handed her the letter drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence  i know you wrote this in a hurry but cady dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days that was when half the school was down with flu  and he wasnt really elected treasurer of the science club he just took over the week bill daley was in the state basketball playoff 
no cady he made second team  a team is a team insisted cady  i dont think youve been quite honest cady he was mad about stars at the age of nine geology you and dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago 
he hasnt been to a symphony concert all season  but he plays bass with chief crazy horse and his five colts even in that he never solos like jack on guitar or rich on sax hes hes just there thats all he likes to play bass because he doesnt have to solo 
but i refuse to be brutally honest and mention chief crazy horse and his five colts anne laughed and cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck  maybe i am padding it a bit anne he said  but you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college he has to have leadership as well as grades 
he hasnt used it now for several years can you really say his motivation for college is electronics cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel  and what would you say he wants to do  its dave who is applying to hanford college 
 i have talked to him but you know ive never tried to push him into any profession i wont be guilty of trying to run his life anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild  just because your father tried to make a banker out of you youve leaned over backward to keep your hands off but subconsciously youve wanted him to conform to your mold 
cady put the wellworn chip back on his shoulder not the kind of leadership you mean working with lots of people remember what you used to say in the army you cant run a war with ninetynine generals and one private cady walked the block to the mailbox almost ashamed of himself for arguing with anne 
and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life lying awake at night he could see them laid out on the floor of his mind when he rose in the morning the image was still there he had always been a messy and negligent man 
no doubt dolores resented following in their footsteps but it was fun those first days kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug there was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things he remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room at a party 
her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as black but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness so he sought her out and spoke to her and thought of his hand in her hair or against her back pressed on the column of vertebrae which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises like the snapped stem of a tulip but to put it bluntly nothing snapped yet that had not seriously troubled him not then 
he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly there was too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting they had left themselves too much to discover but at the start his new life felt invigorating it was on the tenth day after the wedding how could it have been so soon 
 now im not going to pick up those shorts  i think youll get tired of them there in the morning the shorts were where he had left them he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till dolores did for he had just remembered tonight they were having their first guests 
the rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts they gave the room a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute thinking he would get nervous i can be as stubborn as she can he thought shell rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings 
he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet away he could not cross the living room brush past her and bend down to retrieve the shorts bills hat was deposited in the hall closet with the most casual and relaxed manner in the world dolores led anthea to the bedroom then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there 
all evening anthea favored him with odd coy looks clearly she had been instructed not to say a word for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic at last there was a void no one could fill martin realized later on that he should have had it out with dolores that night 
on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fumed while she stayed calm and adamant and if he surrendered after raving at her suppose he ran up the white flag altogether in his head was the echo of those titters with anthea there was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean 
he could even recall the last time he sat there she was talking about him that time because he had done some bad thing something she disliked but afterwards martin said he was sorry he apologized so sweetly i couldnt keep being annoyed with him it wasnt even true that hed said he was sorry that time he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadnt happened which was as honest as he could put it 
if the situation had been bad it now got worse about this time people began dropping in considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough angrily martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip preferably one that lasted months instead of deciding not to postpone the date until he could get away here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores showing them around the apartment 
it was curious how the different visitors took this some tried to ignore the blot on the bedrooms countenance to them all dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale  its a little contest martin and i have she would begin gaily carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course they entered the bedroom and dolores said nothing 
 you were in a hurry werent you martin would have liked to break the mans neck now martin heard himself give a snort of mock good nature with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth ready to begin its a little contest never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment 
but martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything dolores kept picking up any of his clothes except the fatal shorts which he left about but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers in his moments of worst agony martin imagined what his friends were saying he had thought her exactly what he wanted 
pursuing his idea he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself his mind scurried frantically seeking an exit alternately he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly morosely to live out his life in this fashion nothing would change nothing would ever change 
in a frenzy of excitement he considered his plan beside his shorts he would place something of hers instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory for if she picked up say a pair of her panties she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside the expenditure of energy was almost the same he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor furthermore he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly every time he went in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere or maybe a girdle next to his shorts 
martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story the tale he thought would become less gay she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness his lack of control his general male looseness while she remained cool airy and untouched the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he believed in it since his courage and virility were involved because it was truly his 
the next morning while dolores was out of the room he went to her bureau drawer took out a pair of nylon lace pants and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared to his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two garments slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers then hesitated for about a second ah he thought shes going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too 
extending her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and swiftly left the room she did not look at him but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady they breakfasted together but martin did not refer to his triumph and dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible as he relaxed that day martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks he found that he no longer hated dolores he knew how much he had hated her and he was surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling 
 you know ive got one of your cars at home as a prominent industrialist you ought to be interested in his nibs support group isnt his racket down your alley a rush of memory swept him back and he forgot cap how did he start on such a ride to brief glory 
general hersheys draft and doc eddyman and cap were responsible for his first eminence but fearless freddy bryan could take credit if he cared to and he did for the second time freddy needed a job having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by gerry and it was up to arthur willis to provide him with one mr willis bought zenith plastic products a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long island engaged in working out government contracts and installed freddy in an executive position shortly after freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas willis listened patiently and once in a while william was exposed to them at a family gathering 
probably mr willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren gerry began to aid freddy with her father prodded no doubt by joans open contempt for freddy and williams irritating competency another factor must have been the eventual disposal of willis fortune she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with freddy the more likely he was to reward freddy richly upon his death whatever the reasons willis and bryan started expanding zenith 
since they were hunting for national defense contracts adam herberet a man of surprising resources entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections feeling his power freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer heavy industry slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers attracted him the allstates auto company a mediumsized firm which manufactured fourwheeldrive vehicles and other offroad equipment had recently constructed an overlarge modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders it was ripe for amalgamation and freddys instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash and never mind inevitable consequences 
at that point william came into the picture although not much desiring the account he had been appointed advertising head of zenith freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner his work in new york had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure and if he wasnt entirely committed to what he did he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities mr willis eager to have him allied with the family wanted advice beyond the confines of his field and william set out on a serious study of the situation including trips to wisconsin and washington 
i know a guy named jack hamrick a very bright young engineer who was with chrysler and i took him with me to allstates its his expert opinion that the plant isnt well suited to what you have in mind besides that im acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the air force i think adam herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side missiles have thrown everything up for grabs and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here 
this means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough here are a few facts and figures ive assembled cant you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged  well he said there is freddy you know 
he assures me he has people to handle the money raising and ham richert my lawyer says the legal aspects of the wedding of zenith and allstates are no problem i dont like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly mans caution i wish you wouldnt tell freddy im lukewarm ive caused him trouble before and hes beginning to resent me if we dont take care the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides brandishing their cudgels 
 one shouldnt mix commercial affairs with patriarchy but in this case i have no choice im most grateful to you so grateful i wish you were my principal aide instead of freddy not to williams surprise freddy adam and hamilton richert prevailed allied to them was gerry devoting much time to swaying her father and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william was unwilling to interfere further zenith absorbed allstates stock transfers were arranged and freddy became president of the hyphenated combination 
he forgot about az till unhappily he and hamrick were proved correct freddys backing dropped away from him and mr willis was forced to make up the deficit adam beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation couldnt deliver from his end the wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant stock willis held in abundance fell sharply in value 
 you were right he said you and your engineer and im in something of a bind in addition to other defects im a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment will you see if you can help me william spent a long week end closeted with hamrick his recent experience in motor car advertising a love for cars of themselves the existence of azs useless wisconsin setup exposure to exciting conceptions of hamricks that nobody would buy and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but outdated smallcar manufacturer called ticonderoga motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it 
he thought the financing the advertising the production of new models the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult if az could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment if william could hit precisely the right promotion note if the money hurdle was not insurmountable they took nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics and put their arguments down in black and white taking hamrick with him william went to mr willis he was surprised and dubious but impressed by the engineer and the report 
i wish i was younger and less timid ill have to call in the brain trust are you willing to run the gantlet i cant guarantee you a sympathetic audience  well be in there swinging william said but in a way sir youve got to decide it yourself 
if they follow anyone itll have to be you  i should explain theres more here for me than advocating my little dream theres you you mustnt take a fall or publicly back away  i rather like the music willis replied quietly at the meeting attended by freddy richert herberet and the az executive staff with mr willis presiding william and hamrick did indeed run the gantlet 
 oh my god ham richert said a little child shall lead them  its absurd bill freddy said from a pale face  youre leading dad down the garden path  your garden god damn it  i dont enjoy family quarrels adam said 
 hear me out please william begged  im an advertising hustler i admit but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere sure ticonderoga went broke in the lowpriced market bucking the big three their cars werent small enough they didnt have the power they were oldfashioned they tried to sell em on economy and simple merit 
weve all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age look what those little european jobs are doing well woo the consumer with a product not bludgeon him with chromed excess length and weight lets make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction at reasonable rates ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon before the tide changed still honest and stupid and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again waiting for us readymade 
why not come down smartly in the world in a chic fashion with an allstateszenith he swayed them somewhat but the debate raged on mr willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum  nobody will underwrite it im telling you freddy said  i know what im talking about in that department 
 well try to swing the deal on that basis if we cant raise the capital were through why wont you give me a chance he smiled at william and slowly rubbed his hands together  i feel i must answer the question he said since the onus later if any should fall on me i dont relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family 
 all the inlaws have got to have their day adam said and glared at william and freddy in turn sweat started out on williams forehead whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell across the table hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger spikehaired burly redfaced decked with hornrimmed glasses and an ivy league suit jack hamrick awaited william at the officers club  hello boss he said and grinned 
the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee which had overall charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted the septemberoctober term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hardfought primary which was won by mayornominate ivan allen jr  only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous 
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury 
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes  this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said  failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers 
the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee  these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said regarding atlantas new multimilliondollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge jan # the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable on other matters the jury recommended that #

 committee approval of gov price daniels abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce ## million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of ## million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug ## 
it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers  if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said 
rep charles e hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor b jones of houston j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday  senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties 
there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house it would authorize the texas education agency to establish countywide day schools for the deaf in counties of ###### or more population require deaf children between # and ## years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas harris bexar tarrant and el paso would be $###### which would be a savings of $###### yearly after the first years capital outlay of $##### was absorbed parkhouse told the senate the tea estimated there would be ### scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps v e red berry and joe ratcliff

 the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court  some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this  yes your honor replied bellows 
there is a conflict among the defendants  president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio the president spent much of the weekend at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port mass a white house spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion asked to elaborate pierre salinger white house press secretary replied i would say its got to go thru several more drafts 
the last ## cases in the investigation of the nov # election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the ## persons he said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens karns ruling pertained to eight of the ## cases in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case 
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about ### persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the ##th precinct of the ##d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes 
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving ## persons wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another the cases involved judges in the ##d ##th and ##d precincts of the ##st ward the ##st and ##th precincts of the ##th ward the ##th precinct of the #th ward and the #th precinct of the ##d ward the case of the judges in the ##th precinct of the ##d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns after reading his statement discharging the ##d ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them 
the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build ## new medical and ## new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a fight on capitol hill it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $## a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes the social security payroll tax is now # per cent # per cent on each worker and employer on the first $#### of pay per year the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $#### a year and the payroll tax to ## per cent ### per cent each 
the payroll tax would actually rise to ## per cent starting jan # #### if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by # per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to ## billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run # billion or more in the first year #### both figures would go higher in later years other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of ### million to # billion dollars over the next ## years these would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes 
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to ## days for each illness except that the patient would pay $## a day of the cost for the first nine days full payment of nursing home bills for up to ### days following discharge from a hospital a patient could receive up to ### days paidfor nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospitalcare credit hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $## a patient community visiting nurse services at home for up to ### days an illness 
he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children caused by an extended hospital stay  this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals  this is not a program of socialized medicine it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed every person will choose his own doctor and hospital 
apart from the aged care plan the presidents most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools the president said the nations ## medical and ## dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care moreover he said many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they cant afford the schooling costs the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $#### a year for onefourth of the first year students the schools could use the money to pay #year scholarships based on need of up to $#### a year per student 
officials estimated the combined programs would cost ## million dollars the first year and would go up to ## millions by #### the president recommended federal matching grants totaling ### million dollars in ## years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones in the area of community health services the president called for doubling the present ## million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction he asked for another ## million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals 
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation for medical research he asked a ## million dollar a year increase from ## to ## millions in matching grants for building research facilities the president said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the ### million dollars in the ###### budget for direct government research in medicine the president said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them 
legislators who last year opposed placing agedcare under the social security system criticized the presidents plan those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message senate republican leader dirksen ill and house republican leader charles halleck ind said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first house speaker sam rayburn d tex called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the house 
only ## senators were on the floor and there was no record vote a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency in the last eight years all presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a ## hour delay after they are reported to the floor the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d ore in connection with president eisenhowers cabinet selections in #### and president kennedys in #### 
this has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes in oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one anothers problems this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicuous by its absence in the case of portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension 
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members votes since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance is today closer to the nato line on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusks speeches as inconclusive 
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite mr rusks personal popularity that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots the secretary of state himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at natos disposal in european waters the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole 
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent this increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliances most difficult problems in the months to come each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos 
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility the inclination here is to accept a de facto ceasefire in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the ceasefire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make 
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas but with the months moving on and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world the question arises how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression former vicepresident richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union he was critical of what he feels is president kennedys tendency to be too conciliatory 
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in cuba one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didnt attack the kennedy administration on this score his reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination 
this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups it recommends that the united states seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds mr nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated 
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed but thus far there has been no response in kind foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations 
again and again it asked the communists to freeze the military situation in laos but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge buildup administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an allout war over laos 
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos the prowestern government which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the prowestern government to the hilt if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it felt was too trusting of communists it gradually had to relinquish them one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright d of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation in an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the presidents committee on juvenile delinquency and crime to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend the president has also called upon the attorney general the secretary of health education and welfare and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem 
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since #### each year showing an increase in offenders among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in #### about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under ## years of age east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a fulltime director raymond h hawksley the present city cd head believes mr hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time east providence now has no civil defense program 
he is not interested in being named a fulltime director noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nations civil defense program mr hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a fulltime local director he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about $#### a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs mr hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the fulltime cd job one of these men is former fire chief john a laughlin he said 
one advantage that would come to the city in having a fulltime director he said is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said mr hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city mr hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack 
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point mr hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack such vital information he said has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know if the city council fails to consider appointment of a fulltime cd director mr hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally one of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid 
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly the governors move into the socalled blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r grant deputy city clerk of central falls mr notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july ## and sent to the state house by miss grant the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature 
he will then appoint the study committee with mr nugents cooperation the governor said  i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings mr notte said to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and specialinterest groups affected by these laws the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation 
the statutes similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday the only day they have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday the councils resolution said the small shops must be retained for they provide essential service to the community according to the resolution which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors it declares that sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government 
they operate on a volume basis it was contended and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community liberals and conservatives in both parties democratic and republican should divorce themselves and form two independent parties george h reama nationally known labormanagement expert said here yesterday mr reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheratonbiltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day he said he was confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in #### 
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track he steered me to the right track the free enterprise track he said that when he was a socialist in #### the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties 
he said he favors wage increases for workers but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his #### philosophy mr reama said a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own mr reama far from really being retired is engaged in industrial relations counseling a petition bearing the signatures of more than #### johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town william a martinelli chairman of the citizens group of johnston transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr 
mr martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within ## days he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within ## days after the board of canvassers completes its work a difference of opinion arose between mr martinelli and john p bourcier town solicitor over the exact manner in which the vote is handled mr martinelli has in recent weeks been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote while mr bourcier said that a special election might be called instead mr bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures 
mr martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july ## to plan further strategy in the charter movement he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes  after inspiring this i think we should certainly follow through on it he declared  it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than ## members of the group are interested in running on the required nonpartisan ballot for posts on the charter commission 
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday with spokesmen for the towns insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks it was indicated misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses several signers affixed their names it was learned after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system 
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a abatuno to draft the ordinance at the last session of the general assembly the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense 
mitchell was for using it jones against and sen wayne dumont jr rwarren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before ### persons at the park hotel the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club it was greeted with a chorus of boos by ### women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of womens clubs hughes said monday it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired now hes gone the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state 
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign  how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his adminstration mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last falls presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president 
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes remark dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign state aid to schools the continuance of railroad passenger service the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority and making new jersey attractive to new industry mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republicancontrolled state senate must share the blame for this 
 but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time mitchell said jones unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions saved his barbs for mitchell he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises  he calls for help while saying he is against centralization but you cant have it both ways jones said the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities real estate or motor vehicles he said and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue 
his reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the presidents leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states and who has been the symbol to the world of the peaceloving intentions of the free nations  i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste  such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature it can only rebound to mr hughes discredit sen charles w sandman rcape may said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination 
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican partys nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years sandman said the announcement that sen clifford case aj has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr mitchell is a dead giveaway it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jerseys problems  we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington  we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr mitchell some of the glow of sen cases candidacy of last year

he said you can see signs of the republicans feeble attack on the meyner administration but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead he urged new jersey to become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry  we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean the former superior court judge said 
calling the democrats the party that lives breathes and thinks for the good of the people hughes asked a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november hughes supported gov meyners green acres plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development he said legislation for a $## million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday the plan will provide $## million for purchase of open land by the state the other $## million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis 
he said morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas there will be no land left to preserve hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans  after the primary he promised ill be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong dynamic administration im not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee

at the same time reaction among antiorganization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayors reported plan was generally favorable some antiorganization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayors efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept # democratic primary 
their view is that lastminute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate mr wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a buckley the bronx democratic leader and with joseph t sharkey the brooklyn democratic leader as usual he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g de sapio the manhattan leader he is publicly on record as believing mr de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party last night the mayor visited mr buckley at the bronx leaders home for a discussion of the situation 
in talks with mr buckley last week in washington the mayor apparently received the bronx leaders assent to dropping controller lawrence e gerosa who lives in the bronx from this years ticket but mr buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr gerosas successor the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr screvane who lives in queens to replace abe stark the incumbent as the candidate for president of the city council and mr beame who lives in brooklyn to replace mr gerosa as the candidate for controller the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx after his speech reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions published in yesterdays new york times 
 a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are all the same  its see joe see jim he says a political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt selfish and beyond popular control 
corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin oconnors novel the last hurrah but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state 
day after day some new episode is reported the state public works department is accused of having spent $#### to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate  congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers in the senate several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition 
the housing bill is now in the house rules committee it is expected to be reported out tuesday but this is a little uncertain the panels action depends on the return of representative james w trimble democrat of arkansas who has been siding with speaker sam rayburns forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor mr trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans 
the $########## measure which was passed last monday by the senate provides for fortyyear mortgages at low downpayments for moderateincome families it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy they are james j delaney of queens and thomas p oneill jr of massachusetts what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of #### 
mr delaney and mr oneill are not willing to vote on the publicschool measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups according to an official of the corps in the $######## budget that has been submitted for congressional approval $######## would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contractnegotiation stage gordon boyce director of relations with the voluntary agencies said in a washington interview six of these were proposed by religious groups 
interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods means and goals there are a number of ways this could happen the churchmen pointed out and here is an example last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled when he protested the hotel owner said the u s government is paying for it 
 i dont work for the government the american said and then some churchmen remarked there is a more classical churchstate problem can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state r sargent shriver jr director of the corps is certain that they can no religious group he declared in an interview will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes

some predict the administration will settle down during #### and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of jobseekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eightyear quest for the governors office there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session it will really throw his administration into a scramble certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a reenactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the #### legislative session if barnett doesnt call a special session in #### it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session 
legislators always get restless for a special session whether for the companionship or the $#### per diem is not certain and if they start agitating barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the states congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat with eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic delta district and congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature mississippis relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during #### with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house 
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together barnett as the titular head of the democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election now the picture is clouded and even us sens james o eastland and john c stennis who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen 
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue that of finances in state government the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from # per cent to # per cent the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an overall shortage of cash than to segregation 
the administration could not say why $## million was needed for a grantinaid program the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required twothirds vote the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration 
actually davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the sofar losing battle to block token integration this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly they would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be ineffectual passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition 
then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $## million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $## million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one but if the administration should find it does not need the $## million for a grantinaid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration the shortage of cash it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year 
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues in either case it could call a special session of the legislature later in #### to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor it is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature 
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves the new year might see some housecleaning either genuine or token depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had an inside track with the city estimates of the citys loss in the $###### job have ranged as high as $###### 
the hughes concern then took shortcuts on the project but got paid anyway hemphill said the controllers charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures tuesday the city has sued for the full amount of the $###### performance bond covering the contract the philadelphia transportation co is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project the signature of harold v varani former director of architecture and engineering in the department of public property appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project 
managing director donald c wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter the announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the el project before its completion in #### the hughes company and the consolidated industries inc both of #### n #d st filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy law on monday the hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by hemphill and district attorney james c crumlish jr

hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $### for each joint the bid from a belanger and sons of cambridge mass which listed the same officers as hughes was $### per joint but hemphill added bids from other contractors ranged from $#### to $#### per joint bergers decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference wagner said the city paid only $##### to the hughes company 
 we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond berger said wagner replied cant you just see the headline city hooked for $###### berger insisted that we know enough to sue for the full amount douglas m pratt president of the ptc who attended the meeting said the transit company is reviewing the work on the el  we want to find out who knew about it pratt said 
 the ptc is investigating the whole matter pratt said samuel d goodis representing the philadelphia hotel association objected on tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from ## to ## percent last year goodis voiced his objection before city councils finance committee for hotels with #### rooms the increased license fee would mean an expense of $#### a year goodis said his testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses permits and city services

although he never gets to play while the clock is running he gets a big kick several every saturday in fact out of football moritz doesnt even have a nose guard or hip pads but hes one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl thats because he already has kicked ## extra points in ## tries he ran his string of successful conversions this season to ## straight before one went astray last saturday night in the ### slaughter of washington state moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback the position at which he lettered on the #### team 
a ###pound #foot #inch senior from stamford moritz practices nothing but placekicking last year when he worked out at halfback all season he didnt get into a single game  this year coach royal told me if id work on my placekicking he thought he could use me said moritz  so i started practicing on it in spring training moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right kicking leg and as a result several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough 
he kicked several while playing at stamford high school including one that beat anson ## in a #### district game  i kicked about ### extra points in ### tries during three years in high school he said and made ## in a row at one time i never did miss one in a playoff game i kicked about ## in the five playoff games my last two years moritz came to texas in #### but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury he missed the #### season because of an operation on the ailing knee then played ## minutes in #### 
he went into the army in march #### and returned two years later but he was scholastically ineligible in #### and merely present last season place kicking is largely a matter of timing moritz declared  once you get the feel of it theres not much to it ive tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them cant seem to get the feel 
 its kind of like golf if you dont swing a club very often your timing gets off moritz however kicks only about ## or ## extra points during each practice session  if you kick too much your leg gets kinda dead he explained in their first three games the longhorns have had the ball ## times and scored ## times or ## per cent their total passing yardage in three games ### on ## completions in ## attempts is only ## yards short of their total passing yardage in #### when they made ### on ## completions in ## tries

 were just real happy for the players coach bill meek said of the ## victory over the air force academy  i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on it was the first time weve been ahead this season when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal assistant coach john cudmore described victory as a good feeling i think on the part of the coaches and the players we needed it and we got it 
both turned in top jobs for the second straight game  nelson played magnificent football meek praised  he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown he broke that boy air force fullback nick arshinkoff in two and knocked him loose from the football 
one was on a fourthdown screen pass from the mustang ## after an incomplete pass into gannons territory  as soon as it started to form gannon spotted it meek said  he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy halfback terry isaacson had time to turn around he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss the air forces and the games final play was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own ## and returned ## yards 
 he almost brought it back all the way except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice  kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game meek said  hell be out of action all this week he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game 
rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland  hes looking a lot better and hes able to run meek explained  well let him do a lot of running this week but i dont know if hell be able to play the game players saw the air force film monday ran for ## minutes then went in while the reserves scrimmaged for ## minutes  well work hard tuesday wednesday and thursday meek said and probably will have a good scrimmage friday

the texans have two more road games at buffalo and houston before they play for the home folks again and it looks as if coach hank strams men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in preseason reckonings buffalo coach buster ramsey who has become one of the games greatest collectors of quarterbacks apparently now has found a productive pair in two exnational football leaguers m c reynolds and warren rabb rabb the former louisiana state field general came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a #### upset victory over the houston oilers defending league champions  buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star jack spikes though he did the teams placekicking while nursing a knee injury 
 in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job the texans won the game through ball control with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only ## passes  we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack explained stram  they can be going along doing little damage then bang bang they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off 
he was called upon ## times more than all of the other ballcarriers combined and delivered ### yards the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denvers al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson the speedy halfback hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas  that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away said stram quipping i think ill put that play in the book the early southwest conference football leaders texas arkansas and texas a & m made a big dent in the statistics last week texas ###yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a #game total offense of #### yards #### rushing and ### passing a new swc high

it was nischwitz third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies winning streak to four straight they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning he has given only the one pass in his ## innings an unusual characteristic for a southpaw the bears took the lead in the first inning as they did in sundays opener and never lagged 
after al paschal gruonded out jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don werts smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzers glove nischwitz was working on a #hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth 
the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusiks double and outfield flies by porter and wert gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth despite the ##degree weather the game was clicked off in ### thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusiks grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base cliff cook accounted for three of the tribes eight hits 
the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer patti waggin who is mrs don rudolph when off the stage lefty wyman carey another denver rookie will be on the mound against veteran john tsitouris at # oclock tuesday night ed donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn

ogden utah may # ap  boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball  ive had it he told a newsman  i know when my reflexes are gone and im not going to be any ##th man on the ball club this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout 
he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday without an official word to anybody and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno nev where his wife former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen awaited she said when she learned jackie was heading home im just speculating but i have to think jack feels hes hurting bostons chances the union pacific railroad streamliner city of san francisco stopped in ogden utah for a few minutes sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him the conductor said to ritchie i dont think you want to talk to him 
ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand  i told him who i was and he was quite cold i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a doublecrosser and said anything he liston got was through a keyhole he said he had never talked to liston liston is bill liston baseball writer for the boston traveler who quoted jensen as saying 
and so it was over the weekend what with ##yearold warren spahn pitching his nohit masterpiece against the giants and the giants willie mays retaliating with a recordtying #homer spree sunday both of course were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahns hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the #scoreyear milestone and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked wish i was ## and a topgrade big leaguer 
but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the alltime great lefthanders in the games history yes with bob grove carl hubbell herb pennock art nehf vernon gomez et al spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow a ball players ball player as they say in the trade i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct ## #### before a new record crowd for the period of #####  spahnie doesnt know how to merely go through the motions remarked enos slaughter another allout guy who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse 
incidentally only two did it before a home audience bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyns ebbetts field ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies the braves joe adcock lou gehrig of the yankees pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito then with cleveland made their history on the road willies big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion depending on whether youre an american or national fan and anti or proyankee 
in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as ## home runs and stole as many as ## bases willies lifetime batting average of is ## points beyond mickeys the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukees park it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump the denverarea tv audience was privileged to see mays four home runs thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home 
the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the living room athletic club when games were cut off actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy this year i am told the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good especially at the minor league level 
this dissatisfaction led to howsams request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game  the powerful new york yankees won their ##th world series in a #game romp over outclassed cincinnati crushing the reds in a humiliating ### barrage monday in the loosely played finale with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries the american league champs still mounted a ##hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers the most ever used by one team in a series game johnny blanchard mantles replacement slammed a #run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a #run first inning hector lopez subbing for berra smashed a #run homer off bill henry during another #run explosion in the fourth 
the crowd of ##### had only two chances to applaud in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center about ### feet away with two men on momentarily the reds were back in the ball game trailing only ## but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out in the fifth wally post slashed a #run homer off bud daley but by that time the score was ### and it really didnt matter the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager 
 nick skorich the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles was elevated today to head coach skorich received a threeyear contract at a salary believed to be between $##### and $##### a year he succeeds buck shaw who retired at the end of last season the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaws staff jerry williams and charlie gauer skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings the newest national football league entry 
philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player with skorich at the helm the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running rather than passing in the past the club depended largely on van brocklins aerials skorich however is a strong advocate of a balanced attack split between running and passing skorich who is ## years old played football at cincinnati university and then had a threeyear professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers 
he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in #### he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy n y he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers the eagles signed him for shaws staff in ####

arnold palmer and sam snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the metropolitan golf writers association tonight the dinner will be held at the hotel pierre palmer golfs leading moneywinner in #### and snead will be saluted as the winning team in the canada cup matches last june in dublin deane beman the national amateur champion and all the metropolitan district champions including bob gardner the amateur titleholder also will receive awards the writers gold tee award will go to john mcauliffe of plainfield n j and palm beach fla for his sponsorship of charity tournaments 
the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington democrat of missouri arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months he won the masters the united states open and a record $##### in prize money he was heralded as sportsman of the year by sports illustrated and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the professional athlete of the year a distinction that earned for him the $##### diamondstudded hickok belt but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot 
and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all it was neither a spirit of selfsacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all the worlds best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher 
on the narrow fairway of a ###yard hole arnold whipped into his second shot the ball went off in a majestic arc an outofbounds slice he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side  it is possible that i overcorrected he said ruefully 
 it was a nice round figure that ## he said as he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed from the standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an ## in the texas open the idol of the hackers of course is ray ainsley who achieved a ## in the united states open their secondary hero is another pro willie chisholm who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rockstrewn gully willies partner was long jim barnes who tried to keep count 
asked willie at one stage of his excavation project  nae man said willie ye must be countin the echoes nor were there any rules to save him if there had been he would have found a loophole because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book this knowledge has come in handy too 
a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie arnold sent for joe dey the executive secretary of the golf association joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream  i knew it all along confessed arnold with a grin but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings 
thats how he first won the masters in #### it happened on the twelfth hole a ###yarder arnolds iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains thereby bringing local rules into force  i can remove the ball cant i  you must play it where it lies 
 ill do as you say but ill also play a provisional ball and get a ruling he scored a # for the embedded ball a # with the provisional one so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke until a few weeks ago however arnold palmer was some godlike creature who had nothing in common with the duffers but after that ## at los angeles he became one of the boys a bigger hero than he ever had been before 
other items on the agenda during the meetings which are expected to continue through saturday concern television rules changes professional footballs hall of fame players benefits and constitutional amendments the owners would like each club in the fourteenteam league to play a homeandhome series with teams in its division plus two games against teams in the other division however this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks pete rozelle the league commissioner pointed out  well have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other

with a lefthander going for pittsburgh i may use don taussig in center  lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about ## minutes and he looked good hemus said  he should be getting back in the groove before long our pitching is much better than it has shown the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday 
despite the recession pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess gino cimoli bill virdon bob clemente and dick groat eachbill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs friend is off to a great start with a ## record but isnt likely to see action here this week  were getting friend some runs for a change and he has been pitching good murtaugh said

 you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies but what this team had was a little different the boys had a tremendous respect for each others ability they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do  several times i found the players pepping me up where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk wed be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say dont worry coach well get em all right

 greece and west germany have ratified an agreement under which germany will pay $######## to greek victims of nazi persecution it was announced today probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was sold to the public during the past week for many reasons the demand to buy shares in the dallasheadquartered company was tremendous it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell 
in fact very few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than ### shares some dallas investment firms got only ### shares for all of their customers a measure of how hot the stock was can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $#### a share the first overthecounter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler guerin & turner the managing underwriter was at $## a share 
but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market indeed from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ###### to the public at $#### with another #### reserved for morton foods employes at $#### a share there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering  we subscribe ### shares of morton foods of texas 
after it allotted shares to ## underwriters and ## selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone but the result of it all was egt partner dean guerin believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation  i feel confident the stock will qualify for the national list he said meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one 
first the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months driving stocks of all kinds up as a result it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced at roughly ## times #### earnings to yield a little over # per cent on the ##cent anticipated dividend second the potato chip industry has caught the fancy of investors lately and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks frito and h w lay on the market both of those have had dynamic runups in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher priceearnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast runup and third the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of late 
the potato chip industry these days is growing not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger the history of the us potato chip industry is that many of todays successful companies got started during the deep depression days those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives men with the abilities to last almost ## years in the competitive survival of the fittest but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no secondechelon management in their firms so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito

the unsatisfactory ###### expansion he said was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike draper declared as i see it this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today we must be ready for any needed sacrifice he said that from his experience of two years with gen clay in west berlin administration that russia respects our show of strength but that presently were not acting as we should and must he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action and noted that in war you cant buy yourself out and thats what were trying to do

and there she had her first showing of tapestry work theres a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today what most people dont seem to realize if they arent tied up with the thing as i am is that ##% of the problem is transportation i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until at long last both of my boys got squeezed into high school it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to fingerpaint at the grammar school 
now they go to a high school that is two miles away one might think the problem would be similar they could walk ride on a bus or be driven generally they go to school with a girl named gloriana who lives down the block and has a car this is a way of getting to school but i understand it entails a certain loss of social status 
 why dont you walk to school then  my father walked through two miles of snow in illinois  no i said i didnt happen to grow up in illinois i explained however that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom i had to ride a streetcar two miles 
sometimes i got on the wrong car and didnt get to school at all but wound up at the ocean or some other dismal place and had to spend the day there ive tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car she has to have at least one car herself i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife who is only a woman 
they say that when they take a car gloriana doesnt take her car but rides with them but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her so the little car isnt big enough the logic of that is impeccable of course except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself the solution naturally is the bus however its a halfmile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus and its too hard on my legs

that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of selfplagiarisms all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirovs utterly captivating presentation the reasons for this enchantment are numerous but most of them end in ova eva or aya

for a good many seasons ive been looking at the naughty stuff on television so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies after all this years movies are next years television shows so i went to see la dolce vita it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this threehour film 
after television la dolce vita seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night i cannot imagine a single scene that isnt done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week  la dolce vita has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western week in week out there is more sex to be seen in the adventures of ozzie and harriet there is more decadence on ## sunset strip 
in another respect television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg the credits are as unfamiliar as youll find on the robert herridge theater most of the emphasis has been placed on a wild party at a seaside villa producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties the dolce vita gettogether boasted a strip tease carried as far as a black slip 
a frigid beauty and three silly fairies put them all together and they spell out the only fourletter word i can think of dull apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining as a moral shocker it is a dud 
the chronicles paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly  this is a long picture and a controversial one but basically it is a moral enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political cultural and religious glories and when they sell it to television in a couple of years it can be shown without editing tonight atlantic monthly editor edward weeks moderates a round table of four russian writers in a discussion of soviet literature among the subjects discussed will be russian restrictions on poets and writers in the ussr channel # at ###

at last the white house is going to get some muchcopied furniture by that master american craftsman duncan phyfe whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the u s presidents of the ##th century sent abroad for their furnishings the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansions library the suite has been in the same family since the early ####s the gift is being presented by heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey whose famous estate tranquility was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover n j authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set ### years ago 
the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedys fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home it is the aids intention to create in the library a miniature museum of americana before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem mass an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in #### the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace 
the aid committees chairman in charge of the redecoration mrs henry francis lenygon was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project mrs lenygons committee associates announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york include mrs allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j jussel both wellknown manhattan decorators regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e barnes of boston president kennedy couldnt stay away from his desk for the ##minute young peoples concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the ##piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard n c but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music 
it was the first in the series of concerts for young people by young people to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house she was not present yesterday however to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port mass and in his welcoming remarks the president said he was representing her as he approached the open bandstand erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion the band struck up the star spangled banner and followed it with hail to the chief  i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band and we are grateful to them president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl 
he added i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field displaying his knowledge of music the new englandborn president remarked that probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont by young americans and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers and their work is being duplicated all across the united states  this is a great national cultural asset and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me representing as i do today my wife to welcome all of you here today at the white house as he left the bandstand to return to his office the slender suntanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests he expressed surprise to learn that pretty blonde patricia holbrook ## of mount rainier had attended the joseph p kennedy school for the handicapped in boston 
patricia now attends the c melvin sharpe health school in the district each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red white and blue ribbon they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff many of the musicloving members of the presidents staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected 
transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs kennedys social secretary letitia baldrige told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring he said he contacted a friend henry hall wilson on the presidents staff and asked whether his orchestra could play in the series a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the ##student north carolina group to play the first concert one of the most interested students on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house was letitia baldrige social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy  i was an art major in college miss baldrige explained

everybody had heard of van gogh the french impressionist gallery director john walker greeted the group standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery is the only museum in the country to have a fulltime music director richard bales im sure youve heard of him and his record the confederacy along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group went one of the gallerys blueuniformed guards 
a few of them said they preferred contemporary art among the other artists whose paintings were discussed were boucher courbet fra angelico the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallerys rotunda fountain because its on the second floor that imposing somewhat austere and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at #### ##th st nw took on bustling life yesterday more than ### scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their house of the temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader albert pike who headed the scottish rite from #### to ####

the marriage of john and mary black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years john had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous he would come home in the evening tired and discouraged in no frame of mind to play with their three children or spend much time chatting with his wife hurt by his lack of interest and attention mary complained often that he didnt help around the house and that he didnt really care about the family he in turn told her she demanded too much 
without any definite plan in mind she went to a judge to see what could be done the judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from family service before going to a lawyer family service sharing in ugf has five agencies in the washington area they offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up mr and mrs black agreed to a series of interviews at family service of northern virginia the agency nearest them 
the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other they are now working together toward solving their difficulties he gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings and the childrens bedtime is frequently preceeded by a session of happy family roughhousing to outsiders the blacks seem to be an ordinary happy family and they are but with a difference 
family service has helped hundreds of families in this area perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital but to the families it serves their help cannot be measured family service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the united givers fund anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to materialize yesterday park rangers said and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze 
 im hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground the president knew that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable but he was convinced that the realities of power military economic and ideological were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u s and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s khrushchev in vienna june # and # 
the heightened tension in fact had been a major factor in the presidents change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader he was not going to vienna to negotiate the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned but mr kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war 
the first time was in #### when a fulldress big four summit meeting produced the spirit of geneva the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east in #### president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u s that meeting produced the spirit of camp david a spirit it later turned out that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement on the third occasion another big four summit session at paris a year ago there was no problem of an illusory spirit 
the episode tended to confirm the u s belief that propaganda the hope of onesided concessions and the chance to split the allies rather than genuine negotiation were the soviet leaders real aims in summitry thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president mr kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words  as long as mr khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way no amount of either smiles or toughness neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations the president had set for himself the task which he believed vital of awakening the u s and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance 
he wanted time too to review the united states global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating above all he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchevs doorstep at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader ideally he knew it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels but mr kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it 
moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u s was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions both elements the caution about a meeting the willingness eventually to hold one were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e thompson brought back to russia late in february the letter dated feb ## was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk siberia on march # it dealt mainly with a broad range of eastwest issues but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted 
there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva the deadlock has been caused by the russians new demand for a threeman east west and neutral directorate and thus a veto over the control machinery in the u s strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing mr kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament 
the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent moreover moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies including the u n secretariat and the international control commission for laos mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting 
in cuba the u s had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep in laos the picture was almost equally bad u s willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized on soviet terms beyond that allied disagreement about military intervention in laos despite warnings that they might do so allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the procommunist forces as a result the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure 
ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leaders mood was cocky and aggressive he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may # made new inquiries through the u s embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future mr kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may ## after consultation with the allies 
firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week apparently at the insistence of the u s the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting  the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries the meeting will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned ##yearold veteran of the cold war who in mr kennedys own words is shrewd tough vigorous wellinformed and confident and a ##yearold president his birthday is may ## with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy 
the approval did not arise from an expectation of farreaching agreements at vienna the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause 
premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway this time the initiative came in part at least from washington there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity finally there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the presidents making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord 
if tests are to be resumed the argument went it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse after cuba and laos it was argued mr khrushchev will interpret the presidents consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness perhaps even panic and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds moreover the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of americas firm foreign policy commitments the question was raised for example as to what attitude the president would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east 
the shell which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended to cancel out the possibility of future development though this may or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence 
viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy official encouragement is one thing but the downtoearth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds american catholics have responded generously to bishops and pastors appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning 
diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility all of this may be understandable enough it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise yet for better or for worse the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible to understand the past history and the future potential of american catholic higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community 
a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the wellsprings of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship american catholic colleges and universities are in a very real sense the product of private enterprise the private enterprise of religious communities had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees 
this familycommunity spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas i think for example of three womens colleges with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university which is also coeducational this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot 
for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would seem that todays need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its pursuit of excellence at the earlier preacademic excellence stage of catholic education the operation could be conducted on an intramural community basis but with todays demand for professional qualifications and specialized training the need for outsiders becomes more pressing the problem is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but that a different brand is called for commenting on the earlier stage the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decisionmaking noted that the term teacheremployee as opposed to eg maintenance employee was a not inapt description 
and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are in their opinion identified with its highest good and to use that oftrepeated phrase the attainment of excellence the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to the organization which actually owns the university this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clericallay tension but in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one 
there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession much given to attending meetings and conferences expressions of even lowkey dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere 
much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the family just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions 
broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the laymans reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation 
this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with highsounding titles but no real authority in the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be faked competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to preset conclusions without destroying the students illusion that they are making their own decisions 
in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all in the notre dame report reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to luncheontable communication in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy ie members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the antimonopoly laws once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the antimonopoly laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally 
the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr mcclellans hearings into corruption in labormanagement relations and later into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program in addition disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but he pays the employers strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike business week aug # #### reports that the united aircraft company against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants operating 
the company has billed the united states government for $####### of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractors business rep frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the antimonopoly laws to the unions the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the antitrust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained 
it must play a game in which there never is a winner the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy let us look at the heavyelectricalgoods industry in which general electric westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market the industry is so structured that pricesetting by a multiproduct company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated whether marginal or average pricing is applied 
accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price naturally enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time should these giants really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only survivors in the industry uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by unfair competition but if they show selfrestraint they dont get the orders 
engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric sign a wideopen consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows in other words the antitrust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday thursday and saturday and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday the question might be asked dont the managements of the heavyelectricalgoods manufacturers know these facts 
the past usefulness of the antitrust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold in the folklore of capitalism back in #### he wrote p ### the antitrust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure  p ### antitrust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship  p ### when corporate abuses were attacked it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control in this manner every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the antitrust laws 
this escape from control has led to managements evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while a plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license  the penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail sentences were unprecedented in antitrust prosecutions perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle 
quite clearly the antitrust laws are neither effective nor rational and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union those who favor placing trade unions under antitrust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform before #### individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in #### implicit in the writing of section #a of the national industrial recovery act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle the wagner act the tafthartley act and the landrumgriffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining 
if a union cannot perform this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn unsupported by the way by any agricultural subsidy then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them human labor was exactly that a commodity in eighteenth and nineteenthcentury america as early as #### adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work 
eighteenthcentury england upon whose customs our common law was built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies in #### the boston house carpenters strike for a tenhour day was denounced by the organized employers who declared it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining but against labor monopoly the courts shared the opinion of the employers in people vs fisher justice savage of the new york supreme court declared 
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means compare this statement of a nineteenthcentury judge with how congressman martin according to the daily labor report of sept ## #### defends the necessity of enacting antitrust legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment senator mcclellan is proposing the application of antitrust measures to unions in transportation his bill allegedly aimed at hoffa would amend the sherman clayton and norrislaguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union even a sister local in the same international paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the antitrust act to labor in transportation the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action would not be deemed a violation of the antitrust act 
for example the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of antitrust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the antimonopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies in the famous danbury hatters case a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices eg trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment 
labor remained a commodity but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the antitrust laws the courts by interpretation emasculated the act in #### the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company the company sued under the antitrust laws alleging that the unions activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce  what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise 
at a closeddoor session on capitol hill last week secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on us affairs abroad afterward tennessees democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen what herter presented said gore was not a very encouraging review that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions 
president eisenhower held an ### am meeting with top military and foreignpolicy advisers decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately  there is a limit to what the united states in selfrespect can endure said the president  that limit has now been reached through secretary herter ike offered presidentelect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision kennedy through secretarydesignate of state dean rusk declined 
after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the prowestern government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam  in view of the present situation in laos said the pentagons announcement we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific cutting short a holiday at hong kong the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea accompanied by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines on the uss island base of okinawa task force ### made up of army navy marine and air force units got braced to move southward on signal but by weeks end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration see foreign news and the us was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist rather than a prowestern government might be best for laos 
political economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war and they were probably right  it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again said one military man but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground at geneva in #### to get the war in indochina settled the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state north viet nam which then predictably became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the #### geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west 
 the important thing from now on he said is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana russian intrigue in the congo and russian arms drops in laos using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time soviet premier khrushchev sent new years hopes for peace to presidentelect kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply considering the state of the whole world the cold wars three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous but in senator gores words it was not a very encouraging situation that would confront john f kennedy on inauguration day 
the liberal pressure bloc which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group had fought the committee before and had always lost this time they were much better prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable they had the unspoken support of presidentelect kennedy whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck and counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee # to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservativeliberal deadlock or # to remove one of the conservatives namely mississippis ##term william meyers colmer pronounced calmer 
a dour gangling man with a choppy gait colmer looks younger than his ## years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents he is of course a segregationist but he says he has never made an antinegro speech for ## years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee there his vote along with those of chairman howard smith the courtly virginia judge and the four republican members could and often did produce a ## deadlock that blocked farout democraticsponsored welfare legislation a tactic often acceptable to the rayburnjohnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes 
reprisals are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons in #### the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their #### rebellion against harry truman and in #### after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in #### his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage  in the heat of the anticolmer drive last week judge smith threatened reprisal against powell said he we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here  but speaker sam rayburn after huddling in palm beach with presidentelect kennedy decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee and that he was the only man who could do anything effective 
smith flatly rejected the offer and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust colmer whom he is said to regard as an inferior man when missouris clarence cannon got the word he turned purple he shouted and rushed off to the speakers room to object a dangerous precedent cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support to the smithcolmer forces as chairman of the appropriations committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal porkbarrel projects 
as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses it became clear that judge smith could lose his highest count of supporters numbered ## and he needed nearly twice that number to control the ###member democratic caucus the liberals smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes in the democratic committee on committees in the full party caucus and on the floor of the house before they could oust colmer  one big question if colmer was to be purged what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors  in all three arenas they seemed certain of victory especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash 
if the southerners were sufficiently aroused they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party with that possibility in mind arkansas wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of facesaving compromise  here are two old men mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone said a house democratic leader  one wants a little more power and the other doesnt want to give up any the senate launched the ##th congress with its own version of an ancient liberalconservative battle but in contrast with the houses guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guides speech 
a wideranging bipartisan force from minnesotas democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts republican leverett saltonstall was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills new mexicos clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senates notorious rule ## to allow threefifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate instead of the current hardtoget twothirds fair dealer humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators georgias dick russell objected politely and the battle was joined privately the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage 
in #### nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding armed with the nixon opinion the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week hopefully the perennial battle of rule ## then would be fought to a settlement once and for all since election day vice president richard nixon had virtually retired by his own wish from public view but with the convening of the new congress he was the public man again presiding over the senate until john kennedys inauguration 
nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace then went beyond the required sufficient declaration  this is the first time in ### years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated he said the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves gary player the small trim south african was the eventual winner but in all his ## years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap arnold palmer the defending champion lost his title on the ##nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief 
and that is just what happened on the last few holes the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer player was the first to feel its teeth after playing a splendid first nine holes in ## two strokes under par on this fifth and final day of the tournament sundays fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed players game rapidly fell to pieces after a journey through woods and stream he doublebogeyed the ##th 
as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course player was almost in tears he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer by then playing the ##th hole was leading him by a stroke palmer had started the round four strokes behind player and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the ##nd hole he seemed to have the championship won 
in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower afterwards palmer told charlie coe his lastround partner that he simply played the hole too fast he did seem hasty on his second and third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out giving palmer a chance to recover his composure which he had quite visibly lost when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by ## feet palmer was now putting merely for a tie and player who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt 
the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight ## until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters four last year and three this without ever being out of first place as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing oneoverpar ## this remarkable record was still intact thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of ## and ## his threeround total of ### was three strokes better than the next best score a ### by bill collins the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long but palmer knew as did everybody else at augusta that his streak was about to be broken 
long after the erratic climate and the washedout final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes the #### masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player unlike most such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously although this was not exactly the case when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmers towering prestige as if to confirm his stature he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere 
on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and as it turned out neither won it but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous ## to palmers ## thereafter until the masters player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami 
on thursday the first day of the masters the contest between palmer and player developed instantly it was a dismal drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flagstick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences palmers #underpar ## got him off to an early lead which he shared with bob rosburg but player was only one stroke back with a ## 
a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus the spectacular young amateur who had a ## or ken venturi who had a somewhat shaky ## but was bound to do better or rosburg whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augustas treacheries or even old byron nelson whose excellent ## made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf  on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe 
rosburg had started early in the day and by the time palmer and player were on the course separated as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend by about half an hour they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg who ended with a ## was not having a good day as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender player began with a birdie on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie at the #th on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament he birdied the ##th the ##th and the ##th five birdies one bogey and ## pars for a ## 
the roar of palmers gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta only to be answered moments later by the roar of players gallery for a similar triumph at one point late in the day when palmer was lining up a ##foot putt on the ##th a thunderous cheer from the direction of the ##th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed although he later admitted that he had palmer proceeded to sink his ##footer and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence 
and last week at the masters palmer and player did as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was players superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was # under par for the day in fact he went on to birdie the #th and #th as well to go # under par for the first eight holes but players real test came on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring ### yards 
having hit one of the trees the ball came to rest not more than ### yards out player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the #th fairway and settling for a bogey # or gambling the latter involved hitting a full fourwood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered #th green  i was hitting the ball well player said later and i felt strong when youre playing like that youd better attack 
it struck the #th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par # palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles they started on the #th hole a ###yard par# on this day the wind had switched ###degrees from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days 
his bogey # on this hole and subsequent bogeys at # and # along with a birdie at # brought him back to even par starting the second nine palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it when mickey charles mantle the new york yankees man of muscle drives a home run ### feet into the bleachers his feat touches upon the sublime when roger eugene maris mantles muscular teammate powers four home runs in a doubleheader his performance merits awe but when tiny ###pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because as a teammate explained the other team thought no one was out there hits seven home runs in four months three more than his total in #### #### and #### his achievement borders on the ridiculous 
it is the year when # amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and in unprecedented style delivered consecutive grandslam home runs  # willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammates bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game  # the milwaukee braves tied a majorleague record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them and # catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat two of them as a pinchhitter pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike zone and the fact that the knockdown pitch is now illegal 
whatever the reasons not in ## years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records homerun division of all the records in peril one stands apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now doubly dramatic in its jeopardy this of course is baseballs most remarkable mark the ## home runs hit in #### by the incorrigible epicure the incredible athlete george herman babe ruth of the yankees since #### fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruths record and each in turn has been thwarted what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruths amazing september surge 
always in the abortive attacks upon ruths record one man alone a jimmy foxx ## in #### or a hank greenberg ## in #### or a hack wilson ## in #### made the bid but now for the first time since lou gehrig with ## home runs spurred ruth on in #### two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on ## their names are mantle and maris their team is the yankees and their threat is real after ### games in #### ruth had ## home runs after ### games in #### mickey mantle has ## roger maris ## 
this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them to better ruths mark neither needs a spectacular september flourish all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september and he will establish a new record in ruths day and until this year the schedule was ### games baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruths record will remain official unless it is broken in ### games 
 it has to be easier with two of them how can you walk maris to get to mantle neither mantle nor maris understandably will predict ## home runs for himself although both concede they would like to hit ## they stick primarily to the baseball players standard quote the important thing is to win the pennant but one thing is for certain there is no dissension between mantle the american leagues most valuable player in #### and #### and maris the mvp in #### 
the sluggers get along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer mantles in dallas mariss in kansas city they are rooming together mantle maris and bob cerv a utility outfielder share an apartment in jamaica long island not far from new york international airport the three pay $### a month for four rooms kitchen dining room living room and bedroom with airconditioning and new modern furniture mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room 
mantle maris and cerv probably share one majorleague record already among them they have fifteen children eight for cerv four for mantle and three for maris as roommates teammates and homerun mates mantle ## who broke in with the yankees ten years ago and maris ## who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds both were scholastic stars in football basketball and baseball mantle in commerce okla maris in fargo nd as halfbacks both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma sometimes in the minors maris recalls i wished i had gone to oklahoma to an extent the two even look alike 
both are # feet tall and weigh between ### and ### pounds but mantle incredibly muscular he has a ###/#inch neck looks bigger with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders both must have their clothes made to order maris purchases $### suits from simpsons in new york mantle more concerned with dress buys his suits four at a time at neimanmarcus in dallas and pays as much as $### each neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus henry millers tropic of cancer 
mantle is not normally given to public speaking or for that matter to private speaking  what do you and mickey talk about at home  to tell you the truth maris said mickey dont talk much this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying to be cooperative 
but last week when a reporter was standing near mantles locker mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote he said pointing to a darkhaired ##yearold boy ill never forget one time i struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we lost the game i came back sitting by my locker feeling real low and the kid walks over to me looks up and says you stunk maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen 
by his own confession maris is an angry young man benched at tulsa in #### he told manager dutch meyer i cant play for you  meyer sent him to reading pa  benched at indianapolis in #### he told manager kerby farrell im not learning anything on the bench  farrell did and maris led the team to victory in the little world series 
if youre a good ballplayer youve got to get mad give me a team of nine angry men and ill give you a team of nine gentlemen and well beat you nine out of ten times one good indication of the two mens personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes  when i was a kid maris told a sportswriter last week i used to follow williams every day in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not  when you came up to the majors did you seek out williams for advice 
 when mickey went to the yankees says mark freeman an exyankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this hero of his he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this never would be said of him among all the yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else if laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for $# an hour paid more than playing right field for the yankees maris would lay ties on a railroad track 
but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts mantle and maris concentrate on baseball they try to play baseball the best they can mantle beyond any question can do more things well  one of the reasons they get along fine says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men is that both realize mantle is headandshoulders above maris  hitting mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both lefthanded and righthanded maris only lefthanded 
both are good bunters maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base both have brilliant speed mantle was timed from home plate batting lefthanded to first base in ## seconds faster than any other major leaguer maris ran the ###yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio the swift basestealing shortstop of the white sox both are good daring fielders mantle covers more ground 
with this ultimate weapon the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season  american league expansion created inevitably weaker teams only two teams in each league the yankees and detroit the dodgers and cincinnati are battling for first place appropriately the emphasis on the home run at a peak this year came into being at baseballs lowest moment in #### as the startling news that the #### white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball

g david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europes best hotels but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh there the name vaguely connotes newrich wealth a reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art last week in the german city of dusseldorf g david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause on display were ### firstclass paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection and every single one of them was up for sale like philadelphias late dr albert c barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public time jan # thompson at ## is something of a legend in his own lifetime 
even before he hit big money he had begun buying modern paintings he gave the impression of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best he was able to smell a bargain and a masterpiece a continent away and the museum of modern arts alfred barr said of him i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didnt know about he might barge into a gallery start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting he could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys but with dealers he was tough 
he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stones throw outside pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum pittsburgh turned him down just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years 
last year beyeler arranged to sell $####### worth of klees to the state of north rhinewestphalia which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built last week most of the other prizes once offered to pittsburgh went on the block at the opening of the dusseldorf show thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town 
the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color but in all its ### years not a single negro student has entered its classrooms last week federal district judge william a bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a qualified negro boy and girl their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate school in georgia and in alabama mississippi and south carolina as well for ## months hamilton holmes ## and charlayne hunter ## had tried to get into the university 
the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never to mention the color of their skins holmes went to atlantas morehouse negro college where he is a b student and star halfback charlayne studied journalism at detroits wayne state university last fall after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court judge bootle ordered them to apply again charlayne was tentatively admitted for next fall after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state 
the evidence in court was testimony about the interview which for holmes lasted an hour although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution or a beatnik parlor or teahouse no said he but officials still called him evasive they also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested their reason holmes once paid a $## speeding fine had his license suspended 
the real reason for his rejection they argued is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school judge bootles decision the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color the state will appeal but few think it will actually try to close the university  surprised and pleased students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week when the university of chicagos chancellor lawrence a kimpton submitted his resignation last march a mighty talent hunt gripped the midway 
such academic statesmen as james b conant were consulted two committees pondered ### possible kimpton successors including adlai stevenson richard nixon and harvards dean mcgeorge bundy the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator but rather as trustee chairman glen a lloyd put it a top scholar in his own right a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltechs acting dean of the faculty dynamic geneticist george wells beadle ## who shared the #### nobel prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry time cover july ## #### it fell to chancellor kimpton now a standard oil indiana executive to spend his nineyear reign tidying up chicago after the ##year typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins

but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away the man was king leopold # of the belgians who in #### concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good by force he took under his protection or stole ###### square miles of wilderness in central africa this is an area nearly as large as western europe and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity 
they were determined by the points at which leopolds explorers and gunmen got tired of walking the population of the congo is ### million divided into at least seven major culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking ### separate dialects the religions of the people include christianity mohammedanism paganism ancestor worship and animism the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars 
it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done or failed to do in the congo since #### at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property but by #### its record of brutality had touched the national conscience the belgian government itself took over administration commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism one definition of paternalism is the principle or practice on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children 
ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time but when the colony received independence in #### the congolese child if one imagines him to have been born in #### was ## and had until then been treated as an infant the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo which is rich in copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm oil the colony was administered from brussels with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock in inside africa john gunther describes one of these the societe generale as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us say the house of morgan anaconda copper the mutual life insurance company of new york the pennsylvania railroad and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with the united states government as a heavy partner 
they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food but instead of delivering the ration either in actual commodities or in cash at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often would not the children if they received all their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and later go hungry 
during the ####s there were as many as ##### schools in the congo the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte and le chien and write his name some schools were technical the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land and trained many but they did not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college it was their conviction that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history economics and political science 
when the congo received its independence in #### there were among its ### million people exactly ## university graduates why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it in one large oversimplification it might be said that the belgians felt far too late the gale of nationalism sweeping africa they lacked time to prepare the congo as the british and french had prepared their colonies the congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most were unsure what it meant 
 not one drop of blood the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would wash their hands of the mess it is hard to blame them for this yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless 
first there were those congolese among them joseph kasavubu who favored splitting the country into small independent states balkanizing it second there were those moise tshombe who favored nearbalkanization a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority with much power residing in the states third there were those notably patrice lumumba who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government and fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up however the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting 
they had divided the congo into six provinces leopoldville kasai kivu katanga equator and eastern unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant an opportunity for war the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable westernstyle form of government there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces wellwishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations if internal frictions arose they could be handled by the #####man congolese army the force publique which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians 
twentyfour hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other presently the wellarmed members of the force publique many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country the belgian government decided to act and on july ## dispatched paratroops to the congo on july ## the head of the mineralrich province of katanga moise tshombe announced that his province had seceded from the country 
lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them on july ## the security council with france and great britain abstaining voted the resolution which drew the un into the congo vague in wording it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretarygeneral to take the necessary steps to provide the congolese government with such military assistance as may be necessary until through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations the national security forces may be able in the opinion of the government to meet fully their tasks secretarygeneral hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the un troops sent into the congo were to come from african or at least nonwhite nations certainly not from the us russia great britain or france he quickly called on ghana tunisia morocco guinea and mali which dispatched troops within hours 
it took the un three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed un efforts the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems he frequently announced that he wanted the un to get out of the congo along with the belgians and appealed to russia for help  however there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist before appealing to the un or to russia he first appealed to the us for military help and was rejected 
meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo sending lumumba equipment for his wars dispatching technicians and even threatening on occasion to intervene openly but by the end of the threemonth period in october #### something approaching calm settled on the congo president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him control of the government such control as there was and such government as there was passed into the hands of joseph mobutu chief of staff of the congolese army mobutu promptly flung out the russians who have not since played any significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at un headquarters in new york 
but they left behind them large numbers of officers variously called volunteers or mercenaries who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga the seceded province which according to tshombe holds ##% of the mineral wealth of the entire country from october #### to february #### the un forces in the congo took little action there was no directive for it the security councils resolution had not mentioned political matters and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or balkanize it during the fivemonth lull civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo in february the murder of patrice lumumba who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe again stirred the un to action 
although the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably tougher than the earlier one it also urged that the un eject and prevent the return of all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army though president john f kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloys unexpected report from khrushchev his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of us foreign policy last week high up on the presidents priority list was the thorny question of bizerte 
ideally the president would like the french to agree on a status quo ante on bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems mr kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no # man in the tunisian government defense minister bahi ladgham who flew to washington last week to seek us support the conversation apparently convinced mr kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable through ladgham mr kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba 
on the latin american front the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the interamerican economic and social council which the president himself had originally hoped to attend main purpose of the meeting to discuss president kennedys alliance for progress in conferences with nationalist chinas dapper diminutive vice president chen cheng mr kennedy assured chiang kaisheks emissary that the us is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia however the president who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the us if outer mongolias admission comes to a vote 
to africa he sent his most trusted adviser his brother attorney general robert kennedy on a goodwill mission to the ivory coast all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs in effect he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with reason from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston as the great fourjet boeing ### flies is a routine five hours and ## minutes including stopovers at phoenix el paso and san antonio when continental airlines nightcoach flight ## took off at #### one night last week there was no reason to think it would take any longer 
thirtyone minutes later when it took off for el paso hardly anyone of the crew of six or the ## other passengers paid any attention to the man and teenage boy who had come aboard at ### am with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso passenger robert berry a san antonio advertising man glanced up and saw the man and boy accompanied by a stewardess walking up the aisle toward the cockpit  the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach berry said john salvador a farmer from palm desert calif was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit  the kid had a automatic like they issue in the army he said 
the man put his at the head of capt byron d rickards to rickards a ##yearold veteran ## years in the air it was an old story his plane was being hijacked in midflight again much as it had happened in #### when peruvian rebels made him land a ford trimotor at arequipa but last weeks pirates like the cubanamerican who recently hijacked an eastern airlines electra newsweek aug # wanted to go to havana  tell your company there are four of us here with guns the elder man told rickards the pilot radioed el paso international airport with just that message 
they would have to refuel at el paso most passengers didnt know what had happened until they got on the ground jerry mccauley of sacramento calif one of some twenty air force recruits on board awoke from a nap in confusion  the old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to cuba mccauley said and like a nut i raised my hand i thought he was the air force recruiter 
they chose four jack casey who works for continental airlines in houston fred mullen from mercer island wash fla and leonard gilman a former college boxer and veteran of the us immigration service border patrol everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at el paso at ### am they found a large welcoming group el paso policemen border patrol sheriffs deputies and fbi men who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns 
the ground crew which ordinarily fuels a ### in twenty minutes took fully three hours still more time was consumed while the pilot at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a propellerdriven douglas aj actually the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane they had orders to that effect straight from president kennedy who thought at first as did most others that it was four followers of cubas fidel castro who had taken over the ### mr kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane kept in touch throughout by telephone 
as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment from the luggage they learned that the two air pirates far from being cubans were native americans subsequently identified as leon bearden ##yearold exconvict from coolidge ariz and his son cody ## a highschool junior the heat and strain began to tell on the beardens the father by accident or perhaps to show as he said we mean business took the and fired a slug between the legs of second officer norman simmons at ### am more than three hours after landing the beardens gave an ultimatum 
several police cars loaded with armed officers raced alongside blazing away at the tires of the big jet the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ambulances baggage trucks and cars surrounded it at #### pm a ramp was rolled up to the plane a few minutes later fbi agent francis crosby talking fast eased up the ramp to the plane unarmed 
so did hostages casey cleveland and mullen that left only the four crew members crosby and border patrolman gilman all unarmed with the beardens the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand the other in a hip pocket gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance he caught officer simmons eye nodded toward young bearden and i swung my right as hard as i could

the holdback as pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and thus the new funds spent prudently in all the senate signed a check for $### billion which not only included the extra $## billion requested the week before by president kennedy but tacked on $### million more than the president had asked for  the senate on its own decided to provide additional b## and other longrange bombers for the strategic air command  the house which had passed its smaller appropriation before the presidents urgent call for more was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order in other areas congressional action last week included

higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their tollroad bonds traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates 
another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these taxexempt bonds other taxexempt bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february ## according to standard & poors average on balance prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then however in the same threemonth period tollroad bonds as a group have bucked this trend on these bonds price rises since february ## easily outnumber price declines 
you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page many of the tollroad bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of # per cent or very close to that and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds that # per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds its not much more in fact than the return that is offered on u s treasury bonds 
it is the equivalent of # per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $##### of income to be taxed or for a married couple with more than $##### of taxed income a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent ##month period ending in february or march shows what is happening the report is based on a survey by blyth & company investment bankers nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period and there is the bright note the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in #### and early in #### as a result of business recession 
indication the longterm trend of turnpike traffic is upward look for example at the ohio turnpike traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february as compared with those same months in #### then march brought an ## per cent rise in net revenues after operating costs as a result the roads net revenues in the ## months ending march ## were ### per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds 
that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike operating revenues were off in the first three months of #### but up for the ## months ending in march costs were held down despite a bitter winter for the year the road earned ### per cent of its interest costs against ### per cent in the preceding period the roads engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston 
the ###mile illinois state toll highway for example was not opened over its entire length until december #### in the ## months ended in february #### the highway earned enough to cover ## per cent of its interest load with the remainder paid out of initial reserves in the ## months ended in february #### this highway earned ## per cent of its interest in the first two months of #### earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up ## per cent from early #### success for many turnpikes has come hard 
in these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to tollrate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways many rate increases already have been put into effect higher tolls are planned for july # #### on the richmondpetersburg va turnpike and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study progress is being made too in improving motorists access to many turnpikes net earnings of that road rose from ## per cent of interest requirements in calendar #### to ## per cent in the ## months ended feb ## #### 
meanwhile there appears to be enough money in the roads reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years investors studying the tollroad bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike if nothing is done the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in #### west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same 
its going to take time for investors to learn how many of the tollroad bonds will pay out in full already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the breakeven point a top american official after a look at europes factories thinks the us is in a very serious situation competitively commerce secretary luther hodges accompanied by a member of our staff on may ## toured plants of two of italys biggest companies fiat the auto producer and olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines 
 follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant and you learn this  one modern equipment much of it supplied under the marshall plan enables fiat to turn out #### cars a day  two wage costs are a fraction of the us costs a skilled worker on the assembly line for example earns $## a week fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years 
 olivetti had a special interest for hodges olivetti took over underwood the us typewriter maker in late #### within a year without reducing wages underwoods production costs were cut one third prices were slashed the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled  the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout modern machinery 
 hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the us the inflow of foreign capital would help the us balance of payments  hodges predicted i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the us there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports 
important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these an international conference of the big textileimporting and textileexporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting the us will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the lessdeveloped countries over the years point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on their feet 
idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible at the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain lowwage countries to control textile exports especially dumping of specific products to highwage textileproducing countries japan since #### has been voluntarily curbing exports of textiles to the us hong kong india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the lancashire pact none of these countries is happy with these arrangements 
hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons the kennedy hope is that at the conference or through bilateral talks the lowwage textileproducing countries in asia and europe will see that dumping practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas gradual controlled expansion of the worlds textile trade is what president kennedy wants this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products 
in veiled terms thats what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization doesnt seem feasible special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed government research will look into new products and methods import quotas arent ruled out where the national interest is involved 
rather they are impressed with the british governments success in forcing and helping the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products whats happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from lowwage countries among the highestpaid workers in the world are us coal miners yet us coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers mouths water steel company of wales a british steelmaker wants to bring in virginia coal cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively especially in foreign markets 
us coal is cheap despite high wages because of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates on ocean freight many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting narrow and very deep productivity of us miners is twice that of the british welsh coal miners communistled are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal the british government will have to decide whether to let us coal in 
every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes beyond the fivecent fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically im sorry but we dont have that book there wouldnt be much demand for it im afraid behind this reply and its many variations is the everpresent budget problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest what to buy out of the years grist of nearly ##### book titles what to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when your budget is pitifully small 
the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse confronted with this situation most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds in some parts of the country however a cooperative movement has begun to grow under the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the state libraries share their book resources on a countywide or regional basis new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these cooperative systems so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow because it is so large a state with marked contrasts in population density the organization of the new york cooperative offers a crosssection of how the plan works 
at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system in a highdensity area with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve both these types and those in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as #### with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state it was a step in the right direction but it took an additional act passed in #### to establish fully the thriving systems of today under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not as they saw fit 
a large wellstocked library surrounded in a county by smaller ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great a small library may cherish its independence and established ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board within a system however the autonomy of each member library is preserved the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program facilities and services but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system all services are given without cost to members 
to set up a cooperative library system the law requires a central book collection of ###### nonfiction volumes as the nucleus and the system is organized around it the collection may be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection each system develops differently according to the area it serves but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends a certain number of dollars in nassau county for example the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure that has doubled since #### 
the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of ###### volumes by #### the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries 
the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters could then build upon east meadow has philosophy psychology and religion 
history biography and education are centered in hempstead levittown has applied science business and literature while hewlettwoodmere is the repository of art music and foreign languages the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service this kind of cooperation is not wholly new of course 
local libraries find too that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library the system passes on these savings to its members further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing books are not the only resource of the system schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs and to organizations in member communities 
this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults although some classics cut across age groups such as nanook of the north the emperors nightingale and the red balloon workshops are conducted by the systems audiovisual consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective use of film as a library service the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together consequently an experienced childrens librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote wellplanned library activities cooperating with the childrens librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops and frequent visits headquarters has also set up a central juvenile bookreview and bookselection center to provide better methods of purchasing and selection 
story hours preschool programs activities with community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the childrens consultant headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand beyond its boundaries in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the childrens program headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county it prepares cooperative displays posters booklists brochures and other promotional material for use in member libraries it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used 
the system itself is governed by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership in nassau as in other systems the longrange objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and on adult education in general librarians a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results today library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans the teenagers to them especially the librarians with the help of coops hope they will never have to say im sorry we dont have that book 
the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation can cope with the dangers that threaten our society the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read if we are not discriminating in our reading 
we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries although progress has been made in americas system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america the problem grows in intensity each year as mans knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word continue to expand the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition 
now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers merge without let selfs integrity was and is and ever had been mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves the many threesfulfilled on mars corporate and discorporate the precious few on earth the unknown powers of three on earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself there was much to grok loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing all that he had seen and heard and been at the archangel foster tabernacle not just cusp when he and digby had come face to face alone why bishop senator boone made him warily uneasy how miss dawn ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and wailing jubals conversations coming and going jubals words troubled him most 
the word church which turned up over and over again among jubals words gave him knotty difficulty there was no martian concept to match it unless one took church and worship and god and congregation and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growingwaiting then forced the concept back into english in that phrase which had been rejected by each differently by jubal by mahmoud by digby he was closer to understanding it in english now although it could never have the inevitability of the martian concept it stood for in his mind he spoke simultaneously the english sentence and the martian word and felt closer grokking repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus he sank into nirvana 
now he felt light and gay and clearheaded ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him he felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet he stepped out into the hall was delighted to encounter a water brother ben and stinky went home an hour ago and people started going to bed mike felt disappointed that mahmoud had left 
 come on theres some cold chicken and well see what else they went downstairs loaded a tray lavishly  a fine idea mike agreed  warm enough to swim real indian summer jubal said that his nightsight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up and mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it 
as for the night being warm he would have been comfortable naked on mount everest but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure he was considerate of their weakness once he learned of it but he was looking forward to snow seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual as he had read walking barefoot rolling in it in the meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water brother mike liked having light up through the ripples 
what are they doing on mars the question was too wide for the sparse english language  on the side toward the horizon the southern hemisphere it is spring  taught to grow but my people martians i mean 
in the other hemisphere it is growing colder and nymphs those who stayed alive through the summer are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing  of the humans we left at the equator one has discorporated and the others are sad yes i heard it in the news mr booker t w jones food technician first class is not sad he had his own face dark and beautiful 
he rolled toward her and took her in his arms i grok i shall never be lonely again  mike darling they kissed and went on kissing that was almost worse than the first time  you are all right my brother 
is that i mean do you know  well ive been ready a long time goodness we all have but never mind dear as they merged grokking together mike said softly and triumphantly thou art god then as their grokking made them ever closer and mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called him back oh on mars humans were building pressure domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship 
part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a longdistance plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations the old ones neither helped nor hindered this plan their meditations were approaching a violent cusp that would shape martian art for many millennia on earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation marks and spaces time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the federation assembly daily record should be translated into the medium

lunita and hoy published identical denunciations of shorts elevation losservatore romano and the christian science monitor ignored it times of india snickered at it and the manchester guardian simply reported it the fosterites in england were few but extremely militant the man from mars had interrupted him with his work half finished and that stupid jackass short was certain to louse it up foster listened with angelic patience until digby ran down then said listen junior youre an angel now so forget it you too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me now that short is supreme bishop hell do all right he cant help it 
check with one of them go ahead theres no professional jealousy here digby calmed down but made one request oh you can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself but im telling you itll be turned down you dont understand the system yet the martians have their own setup different from ours and as long as they need him we cant touch him 
 you mean this punk can brush me aside and ive got to hold still for it  i held still for the same thing didnt i im helping you now am i not now look theres work to be done and lots of it if you need a day off to calm down duck over to the muslim paradise and take it 
the sooner you act like an angel the quicker youll feel angelic jubal did not hear of digbys disappearance when it was announced and when he did while he had a fleeting suspicion he dismissed it if mike had had a finger in it he had gotten away with it and what happened to supreme bishops worried jubal not at all as long as he wasnt bothered jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom and didnt want to inquire mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches 
jubal couldnt reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting abc vs d then bcd vs a or ab vs cd or ad vs cb through all ways that four women can gang up on each other this continued most of the week following that illstarred trip to church during which period mike stayed in his room and usually in a trance so deep that jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before jubal would not have minded it if service had not gone to pieces the girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing in to see if mike was all right and they were too preoccupied to cook much less be secretaries even rocksteady anne hell anne was the worst 
however we sent a third vessel out a much smaller and faster one than the first two we have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago that is all i can tell you about them  but the third ship came back several years ago and reported  that it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings 
macneff stopped pacing to stare at hal with his pale blue eyes  forgive me sandalphon said hal did not the forerunner predict in his time and the world line that such a planet would be found i believe it was on page ### macneff smiled and said i am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression 
i still bear scars on my back where pornsen my gapt whipped me because i had not learned my lessons well enough he was a good impresser that pornsen as i grew older and was promoted so was he always where i was he was the dormitory gapt when i went to college and thought i was getting away from him he is the one responsible for my getting such low m rs 
no not he for i and i alone am responsible for whatever happens to me if i get a low m r i do so because i want it that way or my dark self does if i die i die because i willed it so so forgive me sigmen for the contrarytoreality thoughts  please pardon me again sandalphon said hal 
perhaps even though this is too much to wish find the forerunner himself  though that does not mean that there may not be such records there the expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to earth i cant tell you now the distance in lightyears or what star this was though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere if you volunteer you will be told where youre going after the ship leaves 
we have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion hal waited macneff paced some more frowning then he said unfortunately only one lamechian linguist exists and he is too old for this expedition  a thousand pardons said hal  but i have just thought of one thing 
 there will be no women aboard the gabriel and if a man is married he will automatically be given a divorce hal gasped and he said a divorce macneff raised his hands apologetically and said you are horrified of course but from our reading of the western talmud we urielites believe that the forerunner knowing this situation would arise made reference to and provision for divorce 
naturally he couched the provision in obscure language in his great and glorious wisdom he knew that our enemies the israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned six months later hal yarrow stood in the observation dome of the gabriel and watched the ball of earth dwindle above him it was night on this hemisphere but the light blazed from the megalopolises of australia japan china southeast asia india siberia hal the linguist saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein 
southern china all of southeast asia southern india and ceylon these states of the malay federation spoke bazaar his mind turned the globe swiftly for him and he visualized africa which used swahili south of the sahara sea all around the mediterranean sea asia minor northern india and tibet hebrew was the native tongue in southern europe between the israeli republics and the icelandicspeaking peoples of northern europe was a thin but long stretch of territory called march this was no mans land disputed by the haijac union and the israeli republic a potential source of war for the last two hundred years 
so for all practical purposes it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government unrecognized outside its own borders its citizens spoke all of the worlds surviving tongues plus a new one called lingo a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper hal saw in his mind the rest of earth iceland greenland the caribbean islands and the eastern half of south america here the peoples spoke the tongue of iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the hawaiianamericans who were busy resettling north america and the western half of south america after the apocalyptic war then there was north america where american was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of frenchcanadians living on the hudson bay preserve 
and somewhere in that enormous light was his apartment but mary would soon no longer be living there for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to tahiti she would weep in private he was sure for she loved him in her frigid way though in public she would be dryeyed her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her not because she had lost a beloved husband but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically if hal yarrow had been killed in a crash he must have wanted it that way 
somehow all the other passengers also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the gabriel had simultaneously agreed to die and therefore being in disgrace they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony no the fish could eat their bodies for all the sturch cared he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome yet he told himself this was the best way 
mary was free to marry again not knowing that the sturch had secretly given her a divorce thinking that death had dissolved her marriage she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt perhaps the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving hals child would no longer be present hal doubted if this happy event would occur mary was as frozen below the navel as he 
he would no longer have to see that fat face hear that whining voiceand slowly feeling himself icy yet burning hal turned there was the squat loosejowled man smiling lopsidedly up at him  my beloved ward my perennial gadfly said the whining voice  i had no idea that you too would be on this glorious voyage 
 sigmen love you too my guardian said hal choking  how wonderful to see your cherished self i had thought we would never again speak to each other the gabriel pointed towards her destination and under onegee acceleration began to build up towards her ultimate velocity ### percent of the speed of light meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship went into the suspensor 
some time later after a check had been made of all automatic equipment the crew would join the others they would sleep while the gabriels drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured upon reaching the desired speed the automatic equipment would cut off the drive and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journeys end many years later the photoncounting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration again a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied 
and the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation these members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel and in the halfyear left before reaching their destination the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed hal yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out he had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of ozagen siddo 
the expedition that had discovered ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand siddo words with an equal number of american words the description of the siddo syntax was very restricted and as hal found out obviously mistaken in many cases his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen yet if he used all of the little means at his disposal he would be instructing his students wrongly 
for one thing the organs of speech of the ozagen natives differed somewhat from earthmens the sounds made by these organs were therefore dissimilar it was true that they could be approximated but would the ozagenians understand these approximations another obstacle was the grammatical construction of siddo instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future siddo used an entirely different word 
the same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses plus the fact that siddo not only had the normal to earthmen three genders of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual fortunately gender was inflected though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in siddo the system of indicating gender varied according to tense all the other parts of speech nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs 
no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer what gabriel was being asked to do now however was to reexamine all his basic assumptions make valuejudgments on them and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives this is not wholly a reasoning process a computer cannot do it all and even in an angel it takes time  or perhaps especially in an angel whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause however did not make it seem any less long to jack 
there was nothing he could do but wait  we misjudged you he said slowly  we had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice of course we have before us the example of the great races at the galactic center individually they are nearly as mortal as you the difference does not seem very marked to us where it exists 
we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half  for now it is clear that we were in the wrong you may reclaim your property and the penalty on hesperus is lifted  i did not perceive this essential distinction either firstborn hesperus said at once i was only practicing a concept that jack taught me called a deal jack what is the nature of this concept 
 we regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what he has given his heart he discovered was pounding  for instance hesperus agreed to help me find my property and i agreed to take him to earth between individuals this process is called bargaining when it is done between races or nations it is called making a treaty 
recovering the property was much less important though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give us  hesperus and lucifer jack said show that we do but this one was not nearly as long  then it is a matter of pleasure 
but you should understand jack that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery visiting the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older  all the more reason then jack said why we must have a treaty we will gladly entertain your young and give them proper living quarters in return for their help in running our fusion reactors but we must know if this is in accordance with your customs and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hands to our hurt 
jack felt a wave of complete elation but in a second it had vanished without a trace what gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments and contract to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless of the applicable earth laws the angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the earthmen but they had no faintest notion of mans perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature the simple treaty principle that gabriel was asking him to ratify in short was nothing less than total trust and it might be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war 
almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion not trust as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders the history of disarmament agreements for instance had been unreassuringly dismal but the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban and a sort of provisional acceptance of each others good intentions on this limited question out of that agreement though not by any easy road eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations suspicion between member states still existed but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentiethcentury rivalry between arizona and california over water supplies 
the trouble with them was that they almost never worked and in fact an agreement in principle historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled suppose that this one were to work there was no question in jacks mind of the good faith on one side at least in fact it had to be tried it would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had ever signed 
but there was no small way to handle this one he turned back to the screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his lips for a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw it seemed to be only a riot of color light and meaningless activity gradually he realized that the pentagon of angel elders had vanished and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up 
 you cant see them yet jack theyll be in range in a short while jack scanned the skies the boards and the skies again no there was a tiny pip on the radar if that was the skiff it was making unprecedented speed 
through the telescope jack could see that both spacesuits were still attached to it the sail was still unfurled though there were a good many holes in it as langer had predicted would be the case by now it was a startling almost numenous sight but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous cometstail of angels the skiff was not heading for the nursery however 
and there would be no chance of signaling them without the nernst generator jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone fuming helpless he watched them pass him the sail ragged though it was still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars he would never have believed without seeing it that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast and why was it causing so much agitation among the angels and being followed by so many of them 
the curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldnt be argued with however the skiff was headed for the very center of the nebula toward that place which jack knew now could hold nothing less important than the very core of the angels life and religion it was clear that langer had at last found a way to attract the angels attention it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off langer would have to be headed off whether he knew where he was going or not 
but not having talked to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line had he decided perhaps that the center of the cloud was a center of government instead of a center of life and faith but it didnt matter now whether he meant to invade the holy of holies or was simply headed in that direction by accident if it was intentional it was now also unnecessary and whether intentional or not the outcome would be disastrous 
when he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses however he hesitated he had to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he had to have it fast but fusion power in the coal sack was what had triggered all the trouble in the first place and he already had an angel aboard  im going to turn my generator back on as i promised to do but i cant take you to earth yet 
will you obstruct this or will you help i know its not part of the bargain and your elders might not like it  nobody else can live in your hearth while i am in it hesperus said promptly  as for my elders they have already admitted that they were wrong if because of this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permitted to go there at all 
without an instants transition the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board always before it had taken five minutes to from here on out the ariadne was going to be hotter than any space cruiser man had ever dreamed of but since he had failed to anticipate it he lost the five minutes anyhow in plotting an intercept orbit  hesperus dont use this ttau vector trick of yours please 
he rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw  ekstrohm nogol you guys okay  nothing wrong with me that couldnt be cured nogol said he didnt say what would cure him he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself 
 well lets take a groundlevel look at the country around here a range of bluffs hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss above them the sky was the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above minneapolis seen against neonlit snow that cold empty sky was full of fire and light it seemed almost a magnification of the galaxy itself of the milky way blown up by some master photographer 
these planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of them did this would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of yancy# in three generations they lay months away from the nearest earth star by jump drive and no one knew what they were good for although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered much like the continent of antarctica in ancient history  how can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely 
 some can be lonely in a crowd nogol said elaborately  what will we need outside ryan  no helmets the captain answered  we can breathe out there all right this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago 
think theyre intelligent maybe hostile  i think theyre dead ekstrohm interjected quietly  i get no readings from them at all sonic electronic galvanic all blank according to these needles theyre stone dead 
 you hold down the fort nogol  i heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldnt get an encephalographic reading on him me i know the mind of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner  im not worried about you misreading the dials nogol just about a lug like you reading them at all remember when the little hand is straight up thats negative 
ryan told him what he could do then ekstrohm smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall the strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects actually the types of infection that could attack a warmblooded mammal were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories he wasnt likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever 
it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow they walked from midnight to noon noon to midnight and came to the beast sprawled on its side  hey this is pretty close to a warthog  one of the best matches ive ever found still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world 
the big man seldom gave out with such thoughts  what shall we do with this one ryan nudged it with his toe following ekstrohms example it sure as hell doesnt look like any dominant intelligent species to me of course thats not definite proof 
 i think wed better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here in the meantime we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent  it looks like we did when we made blastdown  but what about our landing was lethal to the creatures  the planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output 
maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and dont have any rs stored up they could take a lot without harm  then maybe it was the shockwave we set up they curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien like a spaceship  at this stage of the game anything could be possible but theres one possibility i particularly dont like 
suppose it is something right on the planet native to it i just hope it doesnt work on earthmen too ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet there was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being 
ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on yancey# ### there was a keening of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground insects there were on the world but they were frozen solid during the night only to revive and thaw in the morning sun the bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum 
he threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk to the floor there was no longer any need to hide he no longer had to lie in his bunk all night his eyes closed pretending to sleep in privacy he could walk around leave the light on read some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this 
others admitted he was absolutely correct he never slept his body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons occasionally he fell into a waking grittyeyed stupor naturally he couldnt let his shipmates know this insomnia would ground him from the exploration service on physiological if not psychological grounds 
since he couldnt sleep anyway he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports where the hell did he get off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain a man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him in a camp instead of shipboard hiding the secret was easier but the secret itself was just as hard 
he scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldnt seem to concentrate on the weighty pontifical ponderous style on impulse he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air behind him his mates stirred without waking ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble 
the angry burntred face of ryan greeted him  okay stormy this isnt the place for fun and games what did you do with them all the dead animals laying around the ship  what are you talking about ryan 
all i know is that they are gone ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze  ill be damned ekstrohm said expe doesnt like anybody mucking up primary evidence 
 why pick me for your patsy this has got to be some kind of local phenomenon why accuse a shipmate of being behind this  listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of every doubt but you arent exactly the model of a surveyor you know 
 no ekstrohm said no i didnt know that  youve been hiding things from me and nogol every jump weve made with you it fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth youve been involved in  what could i do with your lousy dead bodies what would i want with them 
now all the bodies are missing like they got up and walked away it was not a new experience to ekstrohm  ryan there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies i give you my word im not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition take my word cant you 
i outweigh you fifty pounds and im fast for a big man why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong for her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant she was not alone for there were three other such children in the big citys special nursery soon they all were removed to central laboratory school where their delicate transformation began 
instead of kicking feet helvas neural responses started her wheels instead of grabbing with hands she manipulated mechanical extensions as she matured more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship for helva was destined to be the brain half of a scout ship partnered with a man or a woman whichever she chose as the mobile half she would be among the elite of her kind 
as long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations and there were no sideeffects from the pituitary tinkering helva would live a rewarding rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary normal being however no diagram of her brain patterns no early iq tests recorded certain essential facts about helva that central must eventually learn they would have to bide their official time and see trusting that the massive doses of shellpsychology would suffice her too as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships brain ships were of course long past the experimental stages 
and very very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were but the welloriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the universe so for happy years helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates playing such games as stall powerseek studying her lessons in trajectory propulsion techniques computation logistics mental hygiene basic alien psychology philology space history law traffic codes all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning logical informed citizen not so obvious to her but of more importance to her teachers helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid she would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the subconsciouslevel instruction 
one such group got all incensed over shelled children when helva was just turning fourteen when they were forced to central worlds shrugged its shoulders arranged a tour of the laboratory schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories complete with photographs very few committees ever looked past the first few photos most of their original objections about shells were overridden by the relief that these hideous to them bodies were mercifully concealed helvas class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program 
her subject was large a copy of the last supper and her canvas small the head of a tiny screw she had tuned her sight to the proper degree as she worked she absentmindedly crooned producing a curious sound shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths helvas hum then had a curious vibrancy a warm dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings 
helva looked up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular dirty craters on a flaky pink surface she instinctively regulated her sight until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores assumed normal proportions  yes we have quite a few years of voice training madam remarked helva calmly  vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intrastellar distances and must be eliminated although this was the first time that helva had seen unshelled people she took this experience calmly 
 i meant that you have a nice singing voice dear the lady amended would you like to see my work she instinctively sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further meditation  i am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw  no i say the lady twittered 
 of course some of my color values do not match the old masters and the perspective is faulty but i believe it to be a fair copy the ladys eyes unmagnified bugged out  oh i forget and helvas voice was really contrite if she could have blushed she would have  you people dont have adjustable vision 
 here this will help suggested helva substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last supper on the head of a screw  well remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife the good lord can eat where angels fear to tread  are you referring sir asked helva politely to the dark age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin  if you substitute atom for angel the problem is not insoluble given the metallic content of the pin in question 
 did they remember to program a sense of humor as well young lady  we are directed to develop a sense of proportion sir which contributes the same effect the good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time if the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school they left helva with a morsel as well  singing as applicable to herself required research 
but singing for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis balanced properly between optimism and practicality the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves their ships and personnel from bizarre situations therefore to helva the problem that she couldnt open her mouth to sing among other restrictions did not bother her she would work out a method bypassing her limitations whereby she could sing 
her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice shell people did not strictly speaking breathe for their purposes oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells after experimentation helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone 
she compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them not at all unharmonious merely unique acquiring a repertoire from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall she found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy it would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo soprano and coloratura as she pleased it was to helva only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted 
shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship the aj her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship the neural audio visual and sensory connections were made and sealed her extendibles were diverted connected or augmented and the final delicatebeyonddescription brain taps were completed while helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings 
her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine her first actual flight for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner there were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day helva was commissioned 
consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective partners had there been another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would have been guided to make the first move as it was while central wrangled among itself robert tanner sneaked out of the pilots barracks out to the field and over to helvas slim metal hull  hello anyone at home  of course replied helva logically activating her outside scanners 
 all you have to do is ask he retorted hopefully i thought perhaps there were no partners available and ive had no directives from central even to herself helva sounded a little selfpitying but the truth was she was lonely sitting on the darkened field always she had had the company of other shells and more recently technicians by the score the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive 
it would have killed you in the cabin do you have anything for me mercer stammered not knowing what bdikkat meant and the twonosed man answered for him i think he has a nice baby head but it isnt big enough for you to take yet mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm bdikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the supercondamine hit mercer 
he stumbled and fell but it did not hurt the woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming it was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did the two women babbled and crooned at him 
with most of his mind he was happy he wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this he tried to tell the lady da but the words werent quite straight a painful stab hit him in the abdomen the drug went after the pain and swallowed it 
the pain was gone though it had been crippling the first time he rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert that was a good bite the lady da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position said she im strong too we can die too we can die like real people 
with this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack he was wide awake but he did not feel like doing anything in that beautiful place among all those companionable and attractive people he sat and smiled mercer wondered how long the supercondamine had lasted him he endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement 
he watched his own body with remote casual interest the lady da and the handcovered woman stayed near him after a long time the halfman dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at them and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged mercer saw the sun rise on occasion closed his eyes briefly and opened them to see stars shining 
the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body at last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain he knew all the events which could take place on shayol he remembered them well from his happy period formerly he had noticed them now he felt them 
she smiled at him with benign remote happiness apparently her many torsos stretched out along the ground had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body she meant him well but was in no condition for articulate speech the halfman lay on the ground arteries pulsating prettily behind the halftransparent film which protected his abdominal cavity the halfman woke recognized mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin 
did you ever see a play  you mean a game with cards  no said the halfman a sort of eyemachine with real people doing the figures  i never saw that said mercer but i  but you want to ask me when bdikkat is going to come back with the needle 
we all know what is going to happen we all know when it is going to happen we all know what the dummies will do he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated men were cradled and we all know what the new people will ask but we never know how long a scene is going to take  whats a scene 
the halfman laughed with something close to real humor a scene is just a part of a play i mean we know the order in which things happen but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and theres not much climate here so none of us know how long anything takes the pain seems short and the pleasure seems long im inclined to think that they are about two earthweeks each 
the halfman received a dromozootic implant turned red in the face shouted senselessly at mercer take it out you fool when mercer looked on helplessly the halfman twisted over on his side his pink dusty back turned to mercer and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself mercer himself could not tell how long it was before bdikkat came back once again bdikkat moved among them like a father this time bdikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of mercers thigh a sleeping childs head covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes 
he saw the childface grimace as the head was cut he felt the far cool flash of unimportant pain as bdikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately the next time it was two legs growing from his chest then there had been another head beside his own or was that after the torso and legs waist to toetips of the little girl which had grown from his side 
in between teratologies she was a pretty and shapely woman but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him repeated some thousands of time repeated with smiles and hope people never live forever she found this immensely comforting even though mercer did not make much sense out of it thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and new ones arrived sometimes bdikkat took the new ones resting in the everlasting sleep of their burnedout brains in a groundtruck to be added to other herds 
finally mercer did manage to follow bdikkat to the door of the cabin he had to fight the bliss of supercondamine to do it only the memory of previous hurt bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask bdikkat when he mercer was happy the answer would no longer be available when he needed it fighting pleasure itself he begged bdikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there bdikkat grudgingly agreed but he did not come out of the doorway 
when he said it they thought it exceedingly profound though none of them understood it since it was simply the amount of time that mercer had been on shayol  standard years eightyfour years seven months three days two hours eleven and one half minutes the secret little corner of his mind which stayed sane through happiness and pain made him wonder about bdikkat what persuaded the cowman to remain on shayol was bdikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day surrounded by a family of little cowpeople resembling himself 
he remembered the last time he had eaten actual eggs from an actual pan the dromozoa kept him alive but he did not know how they did it the lady da naked in the dusty plain waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her there were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less the years if they were years went by 
those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of captain alvarez there was night and day but no setting of crops no change of season no generations of men time stood still for these people and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the lady da took on very remote meaning her statement was a hope not a truth in which they could believe they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all 
though they saw the oldstyle chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond bdikkats cabin they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh far long ago some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter mercer read it and so had a few of the others but they could not tell which man had done it the letter scraped on stone had been a message home they could still read the opening once i was like you stepping out of my window at the end of day and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place i lived in
